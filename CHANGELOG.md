# Changelog

All notable changes to TSMIS Reports Exporter, newest first. Each GitHub
release shows only its own section (see `build/gen_release_notes.py`).

## v0.50.0 — 2026-10-23

The Clean Road Highway comparison works again on the 2026-10-22 dev-site export,
and all three Clean Road files now compare against the ArcGIS layers on the
Reports vs ArcGIS matrix.

- **Clean Road Highway rows with no postmile no longer stop the comparison.** The
  2026-10-22 dev-site export has 385 rows on routes 001 and 003 whose begin and end
  postmiles are blank (the 2026-10-02 export had none). Every comparison of the
  file (vs TSN, PDF vs Excel, vs Baseline, vs ArcGIS) failed with *"canonical
  postmile value must be a non-empty string"*. Such a row is now placed by its
  odometer instead, listed as `no postmile @ odometer 7.199`, and the Notes sheet
  says how many there are and on which routes. A file whose rows all have
  postmiles compares exactly as before.
- **Clean Road on Reports vs ArcGIS.** The six Clean Road rows (Excel and PDF of
  Highway, Intersection, Ramp) were greyed. They now compare the site's file with
  our own build of it from the layers, refreshed on the ArcGIS reports tab:
  - **Highway** compares the CA HIGHWAYS build against the site's export, with the
    same row key and format reconciliations as the vs TSN comparison.
  - **Intersection** and **Ramp** are new builds that follow the site's own
    pipelines. Intersection: the site's row universe, an intersection of two state
    routes listed under both, legs picked by route. Ramp: the ramp point's own LRS
    measure for Highway Group, City, Population and seg order. Columns the site
    leaves blank stay blank, except the ramp odometer, which the business
    requirements ask for; it is shown, never counted.
  - On the 2026-10-22 export against the 2026-10-05 layers: Intersection
    16,382 paired, 93 / 3 one-sided, 4,079 differing cells; Ramp 15,214
    paired, 0 / 0 one-sided, 20 cells; Highway 47,557 paired,
    9,590 / 4,078 one-sided, 169,817 cells.
- **CA HIGHWAYS build: a prefix change inside one county.** A layer span that
  changes postmile prefix part-way through a county (a realignment, e.g. Highway
  Group `R39.741` → `40.769` on 001 LA) was split as if it crossed a county line,
  so its second part covered that prefix space from postmile 0. On 001 LA that
  painted Divided over 0–40.8 where the layer says Undivided from 18.29. When the two
  parts add up to the span's own odometer length, the second part now starts where
  that prefix space resumes; otherwise the old rule stays. A span that crosses a
  county line and also changes prefix (128: SON L4.971 → NAP 4.55) now also covers
  the plain stretch of the first county between the two (SON 4.87–24.761). Before,
  that stretch was covered only by accident, by the over-extended earlier span. Against the TSN extract (2026-10-05 layers): 282,832 → 222,076 differing cells, Highway Group 2,530 → 1,363, Population 2,589 → 1,548, paired 52,675 → 52,701. The `CRH-SW-E2/E3` canary's counts move with it; its re-bless is owed on the work PC (roadmap B1).
- **City codes.** Eleven city names the derived table lacked are added, from the
  site's own codes on the same records (Glendale GNDL, West Covina WCOV, Elk Grove
  ELKG and eight more), and the intersection layers' spelling *San Bernadino* now
  reads as SBD.

Verified on this machine through the app's own matrix paths, on the owner's
2026-10-22 dev-site export and the 2026-10-05 layer library; the 2026-10-02
highway comparison (blank-postmile fix only) reproduces its recorded result exactly (47,746 paired, 3,989 /
12,337 one-sided, 141,593 cells). The work-PC run is next (roadmap B1).

## v0.49.1 — 2026-10-22

The day matrices now let you pick which TSMIS site's exports to compare. In
v0.49.0 they showed only the site Settings pointed at, so exports made on the dev
site — the Clean Road files, which only the dev site has — could not be picked
once the app was switched back to the main site.

- **Every source on both sites.** The source list on the vs TSN, vs Baseline, PDF
  vs Excel and Reports vs ArcGIS matrices now offers each data source and
  environment twice — `SSOR / Prod · main site` and `SSOR / Prod · dev site` —
  whichever site the app points at. Each day column reads that site's export, or
  an export from before the site was recorded; never the other site's. Your
  current choice carries over as the site the app points at now.
- **Today's export follows Settings.** The vs TSN matrix can only export today's
  column from the site Settings points at, because the export opens that address.
  With the other site's source picked, it compares those exports but shows no
  export buttons, and **Export today** says why.

## v0.49.0 — 2026-10-06

Every export now records which TSMIS site it came from. Reports wait on the dev
site until they are approved and then move to the main site, so the same source
and environment can be exported from either, and the two are different evidence.

- **Run folders name the site**: `2026-10-07 ssor-prod dev-site` or
  `2026-10-07 ssor-prod main-site` (`other-site` for a custom address on any other
  host). A dev-site export and a main-site export of the same day no longer share a
  folder, and a main-site run never resumes over dev-site files. The name carries
  through to every file inside — the per-route exports
  (`2026-10-07 ssor-prod dev-site highway_log_route_3.xlsx`), the consolidated
  workbooks and the comparison workbooks. Folders exported before this release keep
  their names and read as *site not recorded*.
- **The matrices follow the site the app points at** (Settings ▸ "Use development
  site"). The vs TSN, vs Baseline, PDF vs Excel and Reports vs ArcGIS matrices read
  that site's exports plus the ones from before the site was recorded, never another
  site's. The source picker names the site (`SSOR / Prod · dev site`), and every day
  column and add-day option says which site its export came from, or *site not
  recorded*. Switch the site in Settings to see the other site's days.
- **Dev site vs main site.** In the Compare tab's folders mode, two exports of the
  same source and environment from different sites are labelled `SSOR-PROD DEV` and
  `SSOR-PROD MAIN` — the check to run once a report moves to the main site.
- **Run reports** (`output/run_reports`) carry the site in their name and a Site
  column with the exact address the export opened. Website source captures are
  named the same way.
- The temporary folder evidence images are drawn into now has a short fixed name:
  it was the deepest path the app writes, and the longer folder names would have
  taken it past the work PC's 260-character limit (now 247 at worst).

Verified offline through the app's own export and matrix paths (a new check exports
from the dev address and then the main address); the work-PC run is next (roadmap
B1).

## v0.48.0 — 2026-10-06

Every edition of every report now consolidates and compares. The nine that were
export-only — Ramp Summary (Excel), Intersection Summary (PDF), Highway Summary
(PDF) and all six Clean Road files — joined off the 2026-10-02 statewide export of
every report.

- **Clean Road: Highway, Intersection and Ramp, both editions.** Each one
  consolidates (on the Consolidate tab, and automatically after an Excel export)
  and compares vs TSN against TSN's `CA HIGHWAYS`, `CA INTERSECTIONS` and
  `CA RAMPS` extracts, between environments, and PDF vs Excel. Rows pair on the
  physical location (route, county, postmile prefix, postmile, roadbed). The
  columns the site has no source for are shown as context and never counted, and
  the Notes sheet lists every place the two systems write the same fact
  differently and how it is matched. The PDF editions are read straight off the
  site's print table, whose type comes out as small as 1.4 pt; a print whose
  layout has changed is refused rather than read into the wrong columns.
- **The summaries' second editions.** Ramp Summary (Excel), Intersection Summary
  (PDF) and Highway Summary (PDF) consolidate to the same workbook as their
  sibling edition — on the 10.2 export every count and every mile agrees on every
  route — so each compares vs the same TSN print with the same result, between
  environments, and against its sibling in a new PDF vs Excel check.
- **Every matrix gains the new rows**: 22 report rows on the Everything, by-day
  and vs Baseline matrices, and 11 reports on the PDF vs Excel matrix (5 before).
- **First results** (the 10.2 export vs TSN's September-2025 extracts, so the
  differences include a year of change since TSMIS replaced TSN): Clean Road Ramp
  pairs 15,204 ramps, with 10 only in TSMIS and 206 only in TSN. Most of its
  differing cells are one column, `RAM_BEGIN_DATE`: the site fills it from the
  ramp layer's inventory start date, which TSN keeps in `RAM_CHANGE_DATE` (the
  Notes say so). Intersection pairs 16,201 (260 / 425 one-sided) and Highway
  47,746 (3,989 / 12,337 — the two systems cut the road into segments
  differently). Every PDF vs Excel check matches.
- After updating, import `CA INTERSECTIONS` and `CA RAMPS` into their TSN slots
  (Settings ▸ TSN reports) and build them once; Clean Road: Highway uses the
  `CA HIGHWAYS` extract the ArcGIS comparison already reads (import it the same
  way if that slot is empty).

Verified offline against the full 10.2 export through the app's own matrix path;
the work-PC run is next (roadmap B1).

## v0.47.0 — 2026-10-05

The ArcGIS tab is now laid out end to end: the layers, the reports built from
them, and every export compared against those reports.

- **ArcGIS ▸ ArcGIS reports.** A new sub-tab, between Layers and the comparison,
  lists every TSMIS report the app renders from the layers: Intersection Detail,
  Highway Detail and Clean Road: Highway today, with the other eight listed greyed
  until their builds land. Each row shows what its build is as of, when it was
  built, its rows, whether it came from the layers in the library now, and which
  exports are compared against it. **Refresh all reports** rebuilds them from the
  current layers, one after another, as one queued job; each row has its own
  **Refresh**, and the **As of** box rebuilds a past date. A refresh that fails or
  is cancelled stays on its row, with the reason, until a later one succeeds.
- **Reports vs layers is now Reports vs ArcGIS, and it compares both editions.**
  Each report's Excel export and its PDF edition are separate rows, and both are
  compared against the report's one ArcGIS build, which each row picks up by
  itself — the matrix no longer has its own build button or as-of box. Highway
  Detail (PDF) and Intersection Detail (PDF) are compared for the first time;
  before, a day with both editions compared only the Excel. Rows that can't be
  compared yet stay listed, greyed and compact, with the reason on hover.
- **Big layers get more time.** The first real refresh on the work PC
  (2026-10-05) exported all 40 layers cleanly, but County Code used 54 minutes of
  its 90-minute limit. A layer's limit now grows with its row count, so County
  Code gets about 2¾ hours. (That run's "columns changed" notes were one-time
  renames of the manually exported files — same values — and don't come back.)
- After updating, your Reports vs ArcGIS rows, order and comparisons carry over;
  the PDF rows are new. ArcGIS reports built from the 2026-08-19 layers read
  *built from older layers* — refresh them.

Verified offline and in the preview; refreshing the reports from the new layers
and comparing a day on the work PC is next (roadmap B1).

## v0.46.0 — 2026-10-05

The app now refreshes the ArcGIS layers itself, so there is no more manual
export.

- **ArcGIS ▸ Layers.** A new sub-tab, ahead of Reports vs layers, lists the 40
  TSMIS layers the reports are built from: each layer's rows, when it was
  exported, its size, which builds read it, and how its last refresh went.
  **Refresh all layers** (or tick some and **Refresh selected**) exports them
  with ArcGIS Pro and swaps each one in as it finishes. ArcGIS Pro must be
  installed and signed in on the PC; the app finds its Python automatically, and
  **Choose python.exe…** covers a PC where it doesn't.
- **Check ArcGIS Pro.** One button proves the whole path in about a minute: it
  starts ArcGIS Pro's Python, reads and exports the small SHS Tolls layer, and
  checks the file matches the library's copy. When something is wrong (signed
  out, a different portal active) it says what to fix.
- **The same files as the manual export.** Each layer is read from the TSMIS
  feature service and written with ArcGIS's own Table To Excel tool, field names
  as headers and coded values as their descriptions, under its existing file
  name. A layer is only swapped in after its row count is checked against
  ArcGIS's own count; the file it replaces is kept in `arcgis_layers\_previous`
  until the next refresh, and 00_INDEX.xlsx now records when each layer was
  exported. A manual export in the same shape still works.
- **Builds use the right date.** A layer build's default "as of" is now the
  oldest export date among the layers that report reads, so a partial refresh
  never makes a build claim a date one of its layers hasn't seen.
- After updating, every layer build on Reports vs layers reads *stale* once (the
  library's fingerprint now counts only the layer files, so a note file can no
  longer stale them). Refresh the layers, then rebuild.

Verified offline against a stand-in for ArcGIS (the real export worker runs in a
separate process, including a crash, a stall, cancel and a truncated export);
the first real ArcGIS Pro run on the work PC is still owed.

## v0.45.2 — 2026-10-02

Clean Road reports can now be saved as PDFs.

- **Clean Road: Highway / Intersection / Ramp (PDF).** Three new export editions
  save each Clean Road report through the site's own Print layout: the cover page,
  then the whole table scaled to fit one landscape page width, as the site's Print
  button produces it. Files land in `clean_highway_pdf/`, `clean_intersection_pdf/`
  and `clean_ramp_pdf/`. Tick a PDF edition next to its Excel one and each route
  renders once and saves both files. Like the Excel editions, the PDFs are
  export-only: the app does not consolidate or compare them yet. Verified offline
  against the dev site 9.1 print code; the work-PC run is still owed.

## v0.45.1 — 2026-09-25

Intersection Detail compares again: the site changed its Excel export on
2026-09-25, and every Intersection Detail comparison refused the new files.

- **Intersection Detail compares again after the site's September-2026 export
  change.** The site renamed almost every column heading in the Intersection Detail
  Excel export and swapped the intersecting route number with its suffix. v0.45.0
  refused the new exports in every Intersection Detail comparison. Its message also
  told you to consolidate a fresh export, which would not have helped. The app now
  recognizes the new layout and reads the route number from its new column. On the
  2026-09-25 export: vs TSN 5,036 differing cells (July's export gave 5,092), PDF
  vs Excel identical, and a comparison against the 2026-07-23 day shows only that
  day's 158 real data changes. Older exports still compare, including against a
  new one in the cross-environment and Baseline matrices. If the site changes the
  format again, the message now says the app needs an update. No re-export or
  re-consolidation is needed: the existing consolidated workbook compares as-is.
- **Int St Eff-Date differences now count as Major on the Intersection Detail
  Report View.** TSMIS has matched TSN on over 99% of rows since the site's July
  data refresh, so the ~100 that still differ are real conflicts, not a date
  convention. The same rule already moved Date of Record and the INT/Control/Lighting
  dates into Major. The Notes sheet no longer calls the column structural. On the
  9/25 export the Report View's Major total goes from 2,454 to 2,558; every
  comparison count is unchanged.

## v0.45.0 — 2026-09-02

The ArcGIS tab's main view is now a by-day matrix of every report rendered from
the layers, with one layer build per report that knows which drop it came from;
two comparison fixes ride along.

- **The ArcGIS tab's main view is now "Reports vs layers" — a by-day matrix.** Every
  TSMIS report is a row (the two the app can render from the layers today, Highway
  Detail and Intersection Detail; the rest greyed *no build yet* with the reason;
  the three Clean Road files included, so once the site's exports have a
  consolidator the comparison is our layer build against the site's own file), every
  exported day you add is a column, and each cell compares the report's ONE layer
  build against that day's export — the same one-build-per-report model as the TSN
  library. The library card above the grid names the staged layer drop (its export
  date, read from the export manifest's own timestamp, and a content fingerprint),
  and every build records the drop it came from, so a row built from an older drop
  says so in warning colour and offers a rebuild; the as-of date now defaults to
  the drop's export date rather than the TSN extract's. Builds and comparisons ride
  the shared matrix queue with the usual row/column/all rebuilds, live-formulas
  option, report toggles and drag ordering. The single-report card it replaces is
  gone; the Clean Road vs TSN sub-tab is unchanged and its CA HIGHWAYS build doubles
  as the Clean Road: Highway row's build. Existing builds made before this version
  carry no drop stamp and read as *older drop — rebuild* once.
- **Highway Sequence Excel vs TSN no longer reports an equate as missing from both
  systems.** The Excel export seats the equate `E` suffix on the realignment record
  about a quarter of the time, where TSN (and the PDF edition) put it on the equated
  postmile's own row; since the key is the complete glued postmile, both rows of every
  such relation showed as present in only one system. TSN now declares each relation
  and the export's suffix is moved to the target row before comparing — nothing else
  changes, so the annotation's Description/HG/FT differences are still counted, and
  the Summary and Notes state how many relations were seated and why the rest were
  left as exported. On the 2026-07-09 statewide pair 446 more locations pair on each
  side (57,072 → 57,518 paired; 3,422 → 2,976 only-TSMIS; 12,732 → 12,286 only-TSN),
  no pair is lost, and differing cells rise 30,005 → 30,954 because the newly paired
  annotations carry their by-design cells. PDF vs TSN is unchanged. Existing
  Excel-vs-TSN Highway Sequence workbooks keep their old counts until you rebuild
  them; the matrix cannot tell a comparator change from its inputs (CMP-AUD-246,
  roadmap E10).
- **The support bundle builds again when a TSN library carries both sidecar shapes.**
  A library holding the organized `_state/…outcome.json` and its pre-organization
  sibling gave the two the same archive name; the duplicate-member guard then refused
  the whole zip, so Settings ▸ collect-support-bundle silently produced nothing.
  Every sidecar is now bundled under its real path, `_state/` included (roadmap E8).

## v0.44.0 — 2026-09-02

The dev site's Clean Road Files went live, so the app now exports them; the
website-source capture pulls everything the page uses; and the matrix day
pickers say what each day actually holds.

- **Clean Road File: Highway, Intersection and Ramp now export.** The dev site's
  2026-08-19 build un-greyed the three "Clean Road Files" options and ships their
  report modules, so the three picker entries reserved in July (stable ids
  16/17/18) are real Excel exports. Each is the site's flat, one-row-per-record
  replica of the legacy TASAS clean-road file with the FULL legacy header — 74 THY
  / 55 INX / 34 RAM columns (the first two match the TSN extracts' headers exactly;
  Ramp adds two blank columns to TSN's 32) — with the columns the site cannot
  source present and blank. They ride the same Export button as every Excel
  report, Reset cleans their folders, and Export Everything ticks them. Export-only
  for now, and the picker says so: consolidating and comparing them waits for
  real files to census first.
  Prod may still grey them; the export then fails fast with the usual "currently
  unavailable" message, so pick the development site in Settings until prod
  catches up. Clean Highway runs the site's whole Highway Log builder plus four
  more layer lookups per route, so expect Highway-Log-class run times. Verified
  offline by driving the app's own report selection and Generate sequence over the
  real captured site source — every option on the 9.1 and 8.10 captures, with the
  three new reports rendering the empty state the app recognises; the live data
  path is work-PC only.
- **Capture website source pulls everything.** The Settings capture used to save
  only the scripts and stylesheets the page had loaded, under flattened names. It
  now saves the raw page as `index.html` plus the rendered DOM and then EVERY
  same-origin file the page uses: what the DOM loaded, plus every relative file
  name mentioned in the page or inside any fetched file, followed until nothing new
  turns up — the report modules the page inserts with `document.write`,
  `config.js`, `debug.js`, images, referenced notes. Files keep their site names
  (`shared.js`), and the manifest records the site's BUILD_DATE, its CONFIG
  environment and data source, a SHA-256 per file, and the third-party URLs it saw
  but never fetched. Driven over a served copy of the 9.1 site source it fetched
  every file of a manual capture byte-identical. It deliberately writes no archive:
  the support bundle stays the one zip the app produces, so zip the folder
  yourself to hand it over.
- **The add-day pickers show what each day holds.** A run folder exists as soon as
  any one report is pulled, so a bare date in a matrix's add-day picker read like a
  full export when it might hold a single Ramp Summary. Every option in all three
  day matrices now reads `2026-08-31 · HL HSL RD RS IS ID HD HS` — short codes for
  the reports actually exported that day for that matrix, in row order; an
  export-less today says `today — nothing exported yet`; the PDF vs Excel picker
  tags a family with both editions `HL` and a one-edition family `HL:xlsx`, since
  that cell cannot be built. The codes are defined once in the report catalog, one
  per export, and a day is offered exactly when it carries at least one tag.
- **What the 2026-08-19 site build changes in your exports** — a site change, not an
  app defect. The site now drops retired re-calibration copies of a segment, so a
  Highway Log, Highway Detail, Highway Summary or Highway Sequence export pulled
  after that date can differ from an earlier pull in its DATE OF REC rows and
  values; read a vs-Baseline cell that spans the date accordingly. Postmile mode
  now scopes results to the entered counties and the county list gained YOL and
  YUB; neither touches the app's District/County/Route exports. The vendor's own
  Clean Highway column-to-layer mapping was cross-checked against the app's ArcGIS
  build: it agrees layer for layer on every attribute column and names two sources
  the app had marked unsourced (functional class and a last-significant-change
  date); see `docs/planning/cleanroad-highways.md`.

This release also carries the last bundle of the output-audit program, RB-6,
merged on 2026-09-02 after two independent reviews:

- **A folder comparison with nothing on its second side now refuses at once.**
  A cross-environment or vs-Baseline comparison whose other side has no export
  used to parse the whole first side before saying so — 440 seconds on a
  statewide Intersection Detail export. It now refuses through the empty side's
  own loader before parsing anything, in half a second, with the same message.
- **The report picker says which editions the app can never check.** Ramp
  Summary (Excel), Intersection Summary (PDF) and Highway Summary (PDF) are
  exported but have no consolidation and no comparison — each family is verified
  through its other edition — and the picker now labels them "export only", with
  the reason on hover. The Clean Road exports above carry the same label.
- **Rebuilding a TSN library no longer changes its identity when nothing
  changed.** Two clocks made every rebuild produce different bytes — the
  workbook's own modified timestamp and the two-second ZIP member stamps — so
  pressing Rebuild invalidated every vs-TSN comparison bound to the library even
  when the content was identical. Both are now pinned for the TSN library only;
  every other workbook the app writes is unchanged. **Expect one full
  re-comparison after updating:** the fix moves every dataset's identity token
  exactly once, so every vs-TSN cell reads stale until it is rebuilt, and the
  rebuild returns the same counts.
- **Two must-not-regress notes became executable guards** (the re-skinned TASAS
  print, the stray `GENERATE` line), and the route 140 Highway Log defect is now
  an owner-facing record, `docs/vendor-escalations.md` (VEN-01): on the
  2026-07-23 export alone, the Excel edition of route 140 dropped `R/U`, `TER`,
  `H/G` and `A/C` on every row while its own same-day print carries them. The
  app keeps reporting it; only a corrected export closes it.

## v0.43.0 — 2026-08-31

The ArcGIS "Reports vs layers" tab renders a second report — Intersection
Detail — and the recipe behind it is now a registry rather than a special case.

- **Intersection Detail can be built from the ArcGIS layers and diffed against
  your own export of it.** Highway Detail, the first report on this lane, IS the
  CA HIGHWAYS table printed, so it needs the span engine, a segmentation and a
  merge rule. An intersection is a place, not a stretch: `IM Intersection Detail`
  already holds one row per intersection, so all of that drops out and what is
  left is a mapping table plus three rules. It also needs no CA INTERSECTIONS
  clean-road build first, which the roadmap had assumed was a prerequisite.

  Every rule was **scored on the real 2026-08-28 statewide export over 15,154
  one-to-one paired intersections**, not fitted on a probe case. The row universe:
  the layer holds 38,914 rows but 22,697 are IM-managed shells with the whole
  inventory half null, so the report's universe is the 16,147 current rows
  carrying a Main postmile (against the export's 16,394). Which leg is printed:
  `LEG_TYPE` decides it — Major is the mainline, Minor the cross street — at
  99.4–100.0% on all twelve columns, where the reverse assignment scores
  61.7–95.9%. And the overlay carry rule splits **by column**: Highway Group
  (90.7 → 94.5%) and Rural/Urban (84.0 → 91.3%) improve when carried forward
  across a gap in a span layer, but City drops (98.1 → 74.9%) — highway group and
  rural/urban persist until something changes them, whereas a city is
  containment, so carrying one across a gap invents one.

  `Int St Eff-Date` is `InventoryItemStartDate` on the intersection row — 100.0%,
  exact on every paired row. It was nearly declared sourceless, which is exactly
  the mistake Highway Detail's `RU Eff` was: written off the same way while
  sitting in `SHS Population` all along. **Every printed column has a source.**

  Same-date statewide baseline: 15,177 paired, 8,862 differing cells, 33 of 36
  columns at or below 1.3%. The residual sits in `ML Eff-Date` (11.8%), `R/U`
  (8.7%) and `HG` (5.6%), and the ML class is mostly the export printing a legacy
  default date where the layer holds a real one — a finding about the report
  rather than a gap in the build, which is the distinction this lane exists to
  draw.

- **Adding a report to this lane no longer means editing endpoints.**
  `arcgis_reports.py` is a registry: one row per report carrying the label, the
  build, the comparator and the export consolidators that can supply the TSMIS
  side. The GUI endpoints, the sub-tab picker and the checks all derive from it.
  Either consolidation edition can be the TSMIS side, since both consolidate to
  the same shape.

- **The frozen app now proves the whole ArcGIS lane imports.** Those modules are
  imported inside GUI endpoints, so nothing else in the shipped exe exercised
  them — Highway Detail's two had been unproven since v0.39.0.

## v0.42.2 — 2026-08-31

Stops a printed Highway Sequence row being dropped — and with it, a whole
statewide consolidation reading as incomplete.

- **A "COUNTY END" row printed without a Highway Group code is no longer
  skipped.** The Highway Sequence (PDF) reader recognises a row that carries no
  postmile — "END OF ROUTE …", "CITY END: …", "COUNTY END: …" — by the two
  single-letter codes printed beside it, and required both, because every such
  row in the sets it was censused on carried both. The site prints them
  independently: the 2026-08-31 statewide pull has one ("COUNTY END: SB", route
  144) with the Highway Group blank, and the same run's Excel export carries that
  row with the Highway Group blank too. The reader dropped it, reported "1
  unparsed line", and escalated the whole 252-route consolidation to **partial** —
  which then made every comparison built on it read partial as well, over one
  missing row out of 59,979.

  The rule now follows the File Type code, which every censused postmile-less row
  does carry, and treats the Highway Group as optional. Re-censused over **756
  statewide route PDFs** (the 7.9, 7.23 and 8.31 export sets) it recovers exactly
  that one row and reclassifies nothing else — no page furniture becomes data. The
  8.31 consolidation now reports **complete** with 59,979 rows, matching its Excel
  sibling row for row, and its vs-TSN comparison is complete on both editions.

## v0.42.1 — 2026-08-31

The startup sign-in check now tells you whether it worked.

- **"Background sign-in check finished." now says the outcome.** On start (and
  after an environment switch) the app quietly checks the saved sign-in, and
  sign-in, verify and exports all wait for it. It announced that it was running
  and then closed with a bare "finished" — so the pane confirmed a check had
  happened and never whether you were actually signed in, which is the one thing
  worth knowing at startup. It now ends on one line stating the result: signed
  in with Edge device sign-in (no saved login needed), the saved sign-in still
  works, NOT signed in plus the reason, or — when the check handed the browser
  to another task before finishing — that it stopped early and re-checked
  nothing. That last case is deliberately not phrased as a failed sign-in.
  Detail still goes to the log file.

## v0.42.0 — 2026-08-31

Stops the Highway Sequence self-check reporting a by-design difference in how
the two editions spell a postmile equation, and tells you how much of a vs-TSN
total is punctuation rather than data.

- **The Highway Sequence PDF-vs-Excel self check no longer counts the equate
  convention as a disagreement.** A postmile equation is ONE fact the two
  editions spell differently by design: the print writes an annotation line
  "EQUATES TO <label>" with the flags, distance and suffix blank and the "E" on
  the equated postmile, while the Excel export folds the label, the segment's
  flags and often the "E" itself onto the realignment record. The check now
  normalizes that relation before comparing, so on a statewide same-day pull it
  reports **7 differing cells instead of 3,714** across the same 60,254
  locations. The rule is pair-aware — it closes the moved "E" as well as the
  flags and the label — and it fires only where the PRINT declared an equate,
  only on that relation's two rows.

  What it does NOT hide: the landmark label itself, the target row's own
  HG / FT / Distance / Description, and an "E" that only one edition carries
  anywhere in the relation. Statewide **seven of those remain**, and every one
  is a real disagreement about whether the marker exists at all. Where a
  postmile carries more than one row, each edition matches the relation to its
  own row by content and leaves a group it cannot resolve completely alone, so
  a neighbouring record that merely shares the postmile is never rewritten.
  The Summary and Notes name the class and give the run's relation count.

- **Comparisons now say how much of the difference total is presentation.**
  Highway Log, Highway Sequence, Intersection Detail, Ramp Detail and Clean
  Road vs TSN gain one Summary line: of the differing cells, how many carry the
  same text once punctuation, spacing, quoting and letter case are set aside
  ("NEVADA STATE LINE , END OF COUNTY" vs "NEVADA STATE LINE /END OF COUNTY").
  On the statewide set that is 1,243 of Highway Log's cells and 12 of Highway
  Sequence's.

  **Nothing is suppressed and no total moves.** Every one of those cells keeps
  its red difference state and stays inside every published count — the
  workbook simply says more about a number it already reported. Known
  limitation: the class key keeps only ASCII letters and digits, so a dropped
  accented letter ("PEÑA ROAD" vs "PEA ROAD") can be described as
  presentation-only. It stays flagged and counted; only the label is wrong.

## v0.41.2 — 2026-08-21

Fixes the counts-only option, which could not be turned on, and teaches a
counts-only run to say when it has confirmed the comparison you already have.

- **"Counts only (no workbook)" now actually turns on.** The checkbox on both
  matrix pages could be clicked, reported success, and then quietly snapped back
  to off — so the option shipped in v0.41.0 was unreachable. It was wired to the
  general-purpose settings endpoint, which only handles settings that always have
  a stored value; this one is stored only when it's on, so the save was dropped
  on the way through and nothing complained. It has its own endpoint now, like
  every other matrix toggle, and it sticks, mirrors across both matrix pages, and
  survives a restart. Saving an unrecognised setting is an error rather than a
  silent no-op from here on, so the same class of miswiring can't hide again.

- **A counts-only run now tells you when your existing comparison still holds.**
  A counts-only run writes no file, so whatever comparison workbook a stale cell
  already has is left exactly as it was. When the re-computed numbers come back
  identical to the ones that workbook published, the cell now says **"counts
  confirmed"** with a green edge instead of just showing a provisional figure —
  the saved numbers still describe today's data, so a full rebuild buys you
  nothing but the file. It stays a counts-only cell: the same grey ground, the
  same italic number, still uncertified and still offering a build. Matching
  totals prove the totals, not the workbook's contents — the same figures can
  come from different rows — so the cell never turns green on a preview alone.

## v0.41.1 — 2026-08-21

A performance and polish release: the interface does far less work to show you
the same thing, and its text sizes are consistent for the first time.

**The interface stops doing the same work over and over.** Nothing here looks or
behaves differently — the app just spends a small fraction of the effort keeping
it that way. Three fixes, all with the same acceptance bar: prove the result is
identical, just cheaper.

- **Matrix freshness reads each folder once instead of twice per file.** Working
  out how fresh a cell is meant listing its export folder and then asking the
  operating system about every file in it *twice*. A statewide export folder
  holds 252 route files and a matrix asks this for every cell. Reading the
  directory once instead: **38.5ms → 1.5ms per folder**, and a two-column by-day
  matrix snapshot **90ms → 9ms**. Every matrix answers the same as before — the
  four snapshots were compared field-for-field with the clock pinned. Expect the
  biggest difference on a work PC, where antivirus inspects every file the app
  opens.
- **A burst of updates repaints once, not once per update.** The app receives
  updates from its engine in batches, and each one carried a complete picture of
  the app's state — so a batch of twenty repainted the whole window twenty times
  and threw nineteen away. It now applies all of them and paints the final one.
  A twenty-update batch: **194ms → 21ms**. It also stops repainting the three
  comparison matrices you are not looking at.
- **Greying out the controls during a run is no longer 324 separate writes.**
  While a task runs, every option is disabled and dimmed. That was re-applied to
  every control on every update; it now happens once when a run starts and once
  when it ends, with the dimming done by the stylesheet. The controls end up in
  exactly the same state — verified control-by-control, in every task mode.

**Text sizes are consistent, and every one is a whole pixel.** The interface had
grown **13 different font sizes**, six of them half-pixels — 9.5, 10.5, 11.5,
12.5, 13.5. That is not a detail on a work PC: a 1366×768 screen runs at 150%
scaling, where a half-pixel size falls between real pixels and Windows rounds it
differently from one label to the next, which is what made the app look slightly
unfinished. There are now six sizes, all whole numbers, and nothing can drift
back — a build check refuses a new hand-written size.

The half-pixels were never a finer scale: each was used for exactly the same kind
of thing as its whole-number neighbour, so each pair became one size. Most text
is unchanged; where it moved, it moved by half a pixel.

## v0.41.0 — 2026-08-20

**Refresh a matrix without building the workbooks.** A new **Counts only** option
under Comparison output runs the comparison and reports its numbers without
writing the file. Since writing the workbook is about 70% of the work, that is
close to an order of magnitude: a statewide Intersection Detail comparison takes
**20.4s instead of 185.9s (9.1x)** — and reports the same 21,675 differing cells
and 687 one-sided rows, down to the per-column breakdown.

- **The numbers are the build's numbers.** Not "close enough": the preview runs
  the same loaders, the same normalization, the same duplicate pairing and the
  same counting code, in the same order, and stops before the writers. The
  headline verdict is computed in one place that both paths call, so a preview
  cannot report something a build would contradict.
- **A preview can never turn a cell green, whatever it counted.** No workbook
  means no committed artifact, which by the comparison contract means no
  generation — so a preview is a legal result that certifies nothing. That is
  enforced by where it lives, not by a promise: previews are kept in their own
  store, outside the result cache the matrix reads for truth, and a real build
  clears the preview it supersedes. **A preview that finds zero differences
  shows `match*`, not a green tick** — "no differences" and "certified
  identical" are different claims, and the cell still says "build to certify".
- **It goes stale like anything else.** A preview is only shown while it still
  describes the inputs on disk — same fingerprint, same source identities, same
  producer version, and nothing touched after it ran. If any of that moves, the
  number disappears rather than lingering with a caveat.
- **Off by default**, because the workbook is normally the point, and the log
  says "counts only, no workbook" on every line it applies to so nobody goes
  hunting for files that were never written.

Use it to see where you stand across a whole matrix in a few minutes, then build
the cells you actually need the workbooks for.

## v0.40.1 — 2026-08-20

Comparisons stopped reading their own inputs twice. **Statewide Intersection
Detail: another 16.4% off (1.20x)** on top of v0.40.0, with the produced
workbook byte-for-byte the same one v0.39.3 wrote.

- **The Report View no longer re-opens both input files.** Highway Detail and
  Intersection Detail print a replica of the real report beside the comparison,
  and it needs a few columns the comparison itself doesn't carry — the TSN-only
  ADT block, the TSMIS Location. Those were fetched by re-opening and re-parsing
  the same two workbooks the loader had just finished reading: **14.0s wasted on
  Intersection Detail, 27.9s on Highway Detail**, every run. They now ride the
  read that already happens. Both PDF-sourced flavors get it too.
- **The two readers can't drift apart**, because each projection now lives in
  one function that both the in-pass capture and the standalone re-read call.
  And the re-read is still there: a caller that doesn't hand the loader its
  collecting dict gets the Report View anyway, just slower. Verified column for
  column on the real statewide corpus — 60,083 Highway Detail rows and 16,626 +
  16,459 Intersection Detail rows, exactly equal to what the old path returned.

Measured by alternating the two versions on the same inputs, three paired
rounds; the package digest was identical on all six runs, and it is the same
digest v0.39.3 and v0.40.0 produced.

**Also closed, with a measurement instead of an opinion.** The other open item
was openpyxl's XML writer, which is now the single biggest cost. The one
available lever — swapping its pure-Python serializer for `lxml` — turns out to
produce **different bytes** and to be worth about **2%**, so it fails the
byte-identity bar and buys nothing. A phase breakdown of the remaining 129s
shows no hot spot left: writing is 70% of the comparison, spread evenly across
four writers that each serialize content the workbook has to contain. Making
comparisons meaningfully faster again means not writing a workbook at all, which
is a product decision rather than a tuning one — the roadmap says so and why.

## v0.40.0 — 2026-08-20

**Comparisons are about a third faster, and not one cell of output changed.** A
statewide Intersection Detail comparison that took 202.6s on v0.39.3 takes
127.9s here. Run six more times alternating the two versions, the workbook came
out with the **same package digest every single time**.

- **Composite cell styles are registered once per workbook, not per cell.**
  openpyxl re-walks and re-hashes a font/fill/alignment/border every time it is
  assigned, and the comparison writers hand out a handful of shared component
  instances across millions of cells — a statewide Ramp Detail run builds
  1,339,433 of them. Each distinct component set is now registered once and its
  style copied onto later cells. Every cell still owns its own copy, so the
  formula-injection guard, the Highway Log ditto tint and explicit number
  formats mutate one cell and nothing else.
- **A finished comparison is no longer read back through openpyxl to count it.**
  The Status/Diffs contract is read straight out of the package — same schema,
  same refusals — **5.0s instead of 16.9s** on the 30.8 MB Intersection Detail
  artifact. The reader is stricter than openpyxl in places, and strictness on a
  commit gate would be a way to refuse a good comparison, so it never decides a
  refusal on its own: anything it declines goes to openpyxl, which stays the
  authority on what may be rejected.
- **And it is no longer opened a second time to check it opens.** The validation
  that runs before a comparison replaces a good file has always claimed to be
  cheap — "read-only load is lazy … so it stays cheap even for a big
  live-formulas workbook". It is not: openpyxl sizes every sheet the moment it
  loads one, and because openpyxl's own writer leaves out the sheet-dimension
  hint, sizing reads each worksheet to the end. That is a full extra pass over
  the artifact — 30 MB for Intersection Detail, 120 MB for statewide Highway
  Detail — on every commit. The streaming read above already proves everything
  that check proves, so it now happens once instead of twice. Consolidations and
  every other caller keep the original gate, which is still what decides a
  refusal.
- **This applies to every comparison, with no setting to find.** It is
  output-equivalent, so there is nothing to opt into: cross-environment,
  vs-Baseline, PDF-vs-Excel and the ArcGIS comparisons all get it, not only
  vs-TSN.

Proved on the real corpus through the shipped comparators, at statewide scale on
the two biggest reports, and every blessed canary came back unchanged: Highway
Detail **160,347** differing cells (120 MB artifact, all 27 package members
identical), Intersection Detail **21,675 / 687**, Highway Log route 1 **969 /
87** in both flavors. `build/benchmark_vs_tsn_speed.py --writer historical`
reruns that A/B; `build/check_compare_style_cache.py` holds it in CI, where the
corpus is not available.

*About the timings:* this is a developer machine with other things running, so
single runs swing widely. The figures above come from alternating the two
versions on the same inputs — three paired rounds put the median reduction at
39%, and a quiet-moment pair at 37%. What does not depend on machine load: a
comparison commit now makes **zero** openpyxl loads of its own output where it
made two full reads, and that count is asserted in the check suite.

One thing this deliberately does NOT do. The branch it came from also reused a
single TSN certification per attempt, skipping four of the source-identity
checkpoints around capture, comparison, publish and cache-record. Its own
benchmark priced that whole identity surface at 0.2 seconds against a 60-second
saving, so it bought a fraction of a percent of the improvement for a weaker
correctness contract. It was dropped, and with it the "Fast vs TSN
(experimental)" toggle — once nothing is being traded away, there is nothing to
opt into.

## v0.39.3 — 2026-08-20

The block effective-date rule measured in v0.39.2 turns out to be right for the
Clean Road build too, so it becomes the default everywhere.

- **The Clean Road build adopts the measured rule** (DA5). v0.39.2 left it opt-in
  because there was said to be no TSN extract to measure against; there was one
  all along, just not in the staged location. Scored against the TSN CA HIGHWAYS
  extract on a same-dated build over 52k rows, the primary-layer rule wins on all
  three columns — `LEFT` 57.7%→59.8%, `MEDIAN` 54.4%→62.0%, `RIGHT` 58.9%→60.2%.
  Confirmed by a same-layers A/B of the full statewide comparison: **differing
  cells 287,193 → 281,393, rows matching perfectly 2,841 → 3,687, and pairing
  bit-identical at 52,629** — the rule moves values, never row identity.
- **A repeated landmark now starts its own record** (DA6). Two consecutive
  landmarks with the same text — "BEGIN OF COUNTY" after "BEGIN OF COUNTY" — were
  merged into one record; the export prints both. Worth 85 records.

Two things this deliberately does NOT claim. Neither rule explains about 40% of
those columns against the TSN extract (both sit near 60%, where the same columns
reach 79–80% against the report), so something else still differs there. And row
boundaries remain misaligned: most of the gap is caused by the effective dates
themselves still being only ~80% right, not by a boundary rule — see the roadmap.

Also measured, and worth knowing: **the layer library refresh changed the
historical reconstruction.** Rebuilding as-of 2025-09-08 from the August drop
finds 146 unplaceable source spans where the July drop found 102. Picking an
old as-of date does not freeze the answer.

## v0.39.2 — 2026-08-20

Highway Detail built from the ArcGIS layers gets its own build and its own
measured rules. **Differing cells against the real export drop 211,448 →
180,078, and the number of rows that match perfectly nearly doubles, 9,525 →
19,132.**

- **The block effective dates were computed the wrong way** (DA1). `LB Eff`,
  `Med Eff` and `RB Eff` were the oldest date among all five layers in each
  block — a rule measured on one route, whose own note called it a candidate.
  Measured properly against the 2026-08-17 export over 44–46k rows, each block's
  date is its **primary layer's own**: the travel way IS the roadbed and the
  median layer IS the median; surface, shoulders, special features, barrier and
  curb are attributes hanging off it, not the thing the date describes. Where the
  primary layer doesn't cover a stretch it falls back to the newest of the rest
  (2.3% / 0.1% / 0.4% of rows).

  | | was | now |
  |---|---|---|
  | `LB Eff` | 56.6% | **79.0%** |
  | `Med Eff` | 55.5% | **79.4%** |
  | `RB Eff` | 57.4% | **79.7%** |

  Every single-layer and pairwise alternative scored lower, and all three blocks
  ranked identically and independently — which is what makes it a rule rather
  than a fit. No other column regressed.
- **Highway Detail now builds itself from the layers.** It no longer reads the
  Clean Road workbook. The two are reproducing different things: Clean Road
  reproduces the vendor's CA HIGHWAYS table, so it segments on that table's 74
  columns; a REPORT wants its own columns' boundaries. Building on its own 19
  printed layers removes ~3,100 splits it never draws.
- **It has its own as-of date**, on the Reports sub-tab, defaulting to the export
  day you're comparing against, with a button to snap to it. A reconstruction
  dated differently from the export measures network change rather than
  correctness, and that trap is now designed out instead of only warned about.

The Clean Road build is deliberately UNCHANGED — same segmentation, same
oldest-member block dates. Those columns are counted in its own vs-TSN
comparison and its blessed canary, and the report-side evidence suggests the
same rule would improve them by ~20 points, but that needs measuring against a
staged TSN extract before anything moves.

## v0.39.1 — 2026-08-19

Two fixes to the comparison workbook, both found by rechecking Highway Detail
against a freshly delivered ArcGIS layer library.

- **The Description column is no longer absurdly wide.** A Comparison field cell
  renders `"<A value> ≠ <B value>"` and every column is sized to fit the widest
  pair its data can produce. Statewide Highway Detail has one cell whose TSMIS
  side is a `" / "`-joined pile of landmark names; that single 272-character pair
  pinned Description at Excel's own 255 maximum — wider than the other
  thirty-three field columns put together. Value columns now stop at 60 and
  **wrap** past it, so the bound costs reading room and never content. The sheet's
  field columns are 20% narrower overall. Identity columns are unchanged: they are
  still widened to fit, never capped, because nothing wraps a key.
- **The "unavailable" marker is no longer counted as a difference** (CMP-AUD-245).
  Where the Clean Road build cannot place a source span it writes a reserved token
  instead of guessing a position. Highway Detail rendered from the layers inherits
  those tokens, but v0.39.0 did not inherit the rule that they assert nothing — so
  155 cells meaning "unknowable" were being reported as disagreements, and the
  comparison called itself complete while resting on a build that was not.
  Statewide the differing-cell count drops 207,030 → 206,875, moving exactly the
  four marker-bearing columns and no others; the projection now reports `partial`
  and both Summary and Notes state the condition.

- **`RU Eff` is no longer blank on Highway Detail built from the layers.** It was
  the one printed column with nothing behind it: the CA HIGHWAYS table gives four
  attribute blocks an effective date but gives population only a code, so the
  report rendered it empty and the comparison could only show it, never count it.
  The date was never actually missing — it is `SHS Population`'s
  `InventoryItemStartDate`, the same layer row the code itself comes from, and its
  values line up with the printed column. The Clean Road build now carries it as a
  build-only 75th column, exactly the way it already carries Access Control's, and
  the report prints it. **Every column Highway Detail prints now has a source.**
  It also sharpened the row boundaries: a real change in that date starts a new
  record, which the report does too, so the projection now produces 51,277 records
  against the export's 51,327 — a gap of 50 where it was 130.

The TSN side is untouched. The extract's own 74-column schema is still the exact
gate the library loads it through; our build simply writes a superset, and the
extra column is shown-not-counted when comparing against TSN, which has no
counterpart for it.

Nothing else changed: pairing, every other column's counts, and every other
report's comparisons are untouched.

## v0.39.0 — 2026-08-19

The ArcGIS tab splits in two, and the second half answers a new question: not
"does our reconstruction match the old TSN extract?" but **"does it match the
report TSMIS prints today?"**

- **The ArcGIS tab now has two sub-tabs.** *Clean Road* is everything that was
  there before, unchanged. *Reports vs layers* is new: it renders a TSMIS report
  from the same layer library and diffs it against your own export of that
  report. Both sides are TSMIS, so they should agree — which makes a difference
  worth chasing rather than expected drift.
- **Highway Detail is the first report.** It isn't rebuilt from the layers a
  second time: Highway Detail *is* the CA HIGHWAYS table printed — 33 of its 34
  columns are columns of the Clean Road build — so it projects that build onto
  the report's own shape. One measured build stays behind everything rendered
  this way, and the next report is a mapping rather than a new engine.
- **Two rules make it a build, not a column rename.** CA HIGHWAYS splits a row
  wherever any of its 74 columns changes; Highway Detail prints 34 of them, so
  stretches that agree on everything the report shows are one record, and the
  printed Length is that whole record's extent. And a description is
  start-anchored — landmarks are points, so the stretch after one continues the
  record. Statewide that turns 57,728 table rows into 51,227 records, against the
  export's 51,327.
- **`RU Eff` is shown but never counted.** The report prints a Rural/Urban
  effective date; the table we build from carries the population code with no
  date for it. Rather than invent one, the column is emitted empty and declared
  context — you still see both sides, it just never counts as a difference.
- **The vintage question is put in front of you.** The layer build reconstructs
  the network as of a chosen date, so comparing it against an export from a
  different day measures network change, not correctness. The card names both
  dates and, when they differ, says so in warning colour along with the fix.

## v0.38.3 — 2026-08-19

Evidence images now work on the **vs Baseline Matrix**, and **Highway Detail
(PDF)** is the report they were asked for.

- **The vs-Baseline matrix collects evidence.** Tick *Evidence images* under
  Matrix options and a PDF-edition cell renders highlighted crops of the two
  prints it actually diffed — this day's export and the baseline's — beside the
  comparison, exactly as the Everything matrix's cross-environment cells do.
  Built, fresh cells also get the per-cell camera (regenerate without
  re-comparing) and an image button that opens an existing set. Nothing about
  the comparison itself changes: evidence is a decoration, and a cell reads the
  same with it on or off.
- **Highway Detail (PDF) can be evidenced against another TSMIS export.** Its
  adapter had the TSN-side hooks but never the TSMIS-vs-TSMIS ones, so it was
  the one PDF family the print-pair lane refused. It now supplies them, reusing
  the same locator and geometry its vs-TSN evidence already used — the only
  difference is the row key (the print's own `R012.243`, not the canonical
  roadbed-aware form). That closes the last gap in that lane: all five PDF
  families are covered, on both the Everything and vs-Baseline matrices.
- **The toggle stops describing the wrong lane.** On the vs-Baseline page the
  status lines used to list which reports have their **TSN** prints staged —
  irrelevant there, since both sides are your own exports and no TSN print is
  read. It now says what that lane actually needs.

## v0.38.2 — 2026-08-18

The matrices answer the pointer. Reordering day columns actually worked in
v0.30.0's *settings* but never on *screen*, and every matrix chip sat inert for
a full backend round trip before showing anything.

- **Dragging a day column now moves it.** The vs-TSN, vs-Baseline and PDF-vs-Excel
  matrices persisted the new order and then never repainted — the column snapped
  back while the setting silently changed underneath, so the reorder only
  appeared the next time you opened the tab. Every row drag already re-rendered;
  the three day-column drops were the ones missing it.
- **The column's own name is a drag handle.** Only the 11px `⠿` glyph started a
  drag before, so the natural "grab the title and pull" gesture did nothing. The
  grip is bigger and tints on hover; buttons and the TSN picker in the same
  header stay undraggable so their clicks still work.
- **Report/environment chips flip the instant you click them**, then reconcile
  with the backend. A refusal (the "keep at least one on" rule) puts the chip
  back and says why. Adding a day column can't be answered optimistically, so
  that button dims and shows a wait cursor immediately instead of going dead.
- **Toggling a report no longer rebuilds a whole matrix snapshot to check one
  key.** The three by-day matrices validated against `snapshot()["all_rows"]` —
  a filesystem walk plus a TSN-library hash — where the Everything matrix always
  used the registry. Same key set (proved), ~28 ms → ~0.03 ms.
- **The TSN raw library is no longer re-hashed on every repaint.** `status()`
  re-derives the raw manifest on each matrix snapshot, and that re-read and
  SHA-256'd every raw source file each time — 16 MB per repaint on a sparse
  library, far more on a stocked one, on every tab entry, chip click, day add and
  drag. The read-only manifest now memoizes per file against the change token
  CMP-AUD-080 requires (`artifact_store.content_digest`). The byte-capturing path
  the consolidators use is untouched, both produce identical manifests, and a
  mutated-while-read member is still refused.
- Press feedback on the controls that had none: the report picker rows, the
  "set all comparisons to…" chips, the TSN picker buttons, and the matrix header
  buttons.
- **Manual comparisons get an Export-day dropdown** (the last open item from the
  owner's app-consistency list). The file-based comparisons made you Browse to two
  workbooks the app could already locate — the folder-based ones have filtered
  themselves since v0.30.0. Now every file recipe offers a day picker that fills
  BOTH sides: the same day's other edition for a PDF-vs-Excel self-check, the TSN
  library's current file for a vs-TSN one. It offers only days already
  consolidated, defaults to the newest, says "this side only" when the TSN half
  isn't resolvable, and steps aside the moment you Browse.
- Verified the rest of that list against the code: all 13 items are implemented,
  twelve of them since v0.32.0. The roadmap had been describing finished work as
  an unstarted project.

**The Highway Summary comparison stops reporting incomplete coverage.**

- The statewide TSN print masks one figure that overflowed its column width
  (`MEDIAN BARRIER: Z- NO BARRIER`). That single gap was making the whole
  normalized library PARTIAL, which the comparison propagated as "1 input
  skipped — coverage is incomplete", leaving the cell permanently amber.
- TSN is a retired database and that print is frozen, so the gap can never close.
  A masked value is now **disregarded**: the build returns complete. The category
  is still shown one-sided with its TSMIS value, and recorded in the workbook's
  metadata — disregarded, never zeroed, never hidden.
- A category the print never mentions at all is treated differently and still
  reports incomplete: that would mean the parse or the category list drifted,
  which is worth knowing about.
- The TSN Highway Summary library rebuilds itself once to pick this up.

**Highway Detail vs TSN: 14,490 differences that were never differences.**

> Corrected after tagging: the first published notes said 178,184 → 163,694. Those
> came from a shortcut measurement and were both overstated by 3,347; the counts
> below are what the app itself reports. The 14,490 figure was never affected.

- TSN's Highway Detail prints one roadbed's values and fills the other roadbed's
  columns with `+` marks — a pointer meaning "this roadbed isn't what this row is
  about; its value is on the paired row". TSMIS writes the value out in full. The
  comparison was reading those `+` marks as data and reporting each one as a
  disagreement.
- **The statewide total goes from 174,837 differing cells to 160,347.** Nothing
  about the pairing changed — the same 48,477 locations match, with the same 2,850
  only-in-TSMIS and 11,606 only-in-TSN.
- Those cells now show their raw `+`, tinted, with the paired roadbed's value on
  hover. About four in five resolve; where no paired row covers that postmile, or
  two disagree, the hover says so instead of guessing.
- The PDF-vs-Excel self-check deliberately keeps the old behavior: both sides there
  expand their dittos, so a stray `+` means a parser bug and must still be flagged.
- **Read the new total the right way.** It is still dominated by the 11-month gap
  between a frozen September-2025 TSN and a 2026-08-17 export. This removed notation
  that was never a disagreement; it cannot make a vs-TSN total approach zero.

## v0.38.1 — 2026-08-18

Hotfix on v0.38.0, caught by walking the report-integration ladder.

- **Selecting Highway Summary in BOTH editions saved them in the wrong order.** The new print edition was missing from the list of saves that rebuild the page, so a combined run could capture the PDF first — which replaces the report area and destroys the Export button the Excel edition then needs. Every other print edition was already listed.
- The check that guards this no longer keeps its own list: it now reads each export's save and requires any save that calls the site's own print function to be ordered last. It fails on the v0.38.0 code.

## v0.38.0 — 2026-08-18

Highway Detail's two editions now agree **exactly**. The statewide PDF-vs-Excel
self-check reads 51,327 locations, 0 one-sided, **51,327 fully identical, 0
differing cells** — the last four open Highway Detail correctness findings are
closed, the vs-TSN comparison gained the source facts it used to blank, and the
Highway Summary print edition is ready for the day the site's PDFs arrive.

### Highway Detail (PDF): the last differing row is gone

- **Multi-baseline records are no longer truncated.** A record's second line can
  print as several baselines — a long Description wraps at the print line height
  while the attribute cells wrap much tighter — and the converter used to take
  the FIRST baseline as the whole line and discard the rest. One record statewide
  hit it (route 395 at PM `R000.000E`): its Description came out cut off
  mid-word and all 23 attribute columns came out empty, while the run still
  reported success. The converter now keeps a record open and merges every
  following baseline into it, closing at the next record, a district/county
  group header, or the end of the document — so a record's text survives a page
  break too. That row now carries its full description and every attribute,
  matching the Excel export cell for cell.
- **Highway Detail (PDF) consolidation reports COMPLETE again.** The two "data
  lines that reconcile to no record" that had been marking every run partial
  were those same two baselines. Nothing was lost — they were being counted
  instead of merged.
- The safety net is still there, and is now sharper: a continuation that would
  overwrite an attribute the record had already filled is counted and marks the
  run partial, because that is what a genuinely misplaced line looks like.
  Statewide there are zero of them.

### Highway Detail vs TSN: the Report View stopped showing blanks

- **The DCR column and the whole TSN-only ADT block (LK-AHD / P / LK-BACK /
  CHG-MILE / DVM) now show real values.** They could only ever be read from a
  raw TSN workbook, so every comparison run the normal way — off the cached TSN
  library — showed all six columns empty. The library now carries them.
- **The comparison says which snapshot it compared.** The TSN extract's printed
  reference date and report date are captured when the library is built, checked
  to be one real date each (a dump carrying two snapshots, a blank, or a
  non-date is refused rather than averaged over), and the Notes sheet now names
  them, explains the gap between them, and says plainly when they are unknown.
  They used to be described as database ids, which they are not.
- **County pairing is now stated outright.** The Highway Detail export carries no
  county column and the Excel and PDF editions are kept as separate sources, so
  the Notes now say the pairing is county-blind and give the measured exposure:
  524 of 59,457 route+postmile keys carry more than one row and 438 of those
  span counties (976 rows, 1.6%) — only those pair by similarity; everything
  else pairs on an exact unique key.
- The TSN Highway Detail library rebuilds itself once on first use after
  updating (it now stores more of the source than it used to).

### Highway Summary (PDF)

- **New export edition.** The same "Highway Summary" report saved through the
  site's own Print layout, alongside the Excel edition — and selecting both
  produces both files from a single render. Export-only for now: the
  consolidator and comparisons follow once real statewide prints exist to verify
  a parser against.

### Also

- **Delete all reports** now clears the Intersection Detail and Intersection
  Summary export folders, which it had been leaving behind. The check that is
  supposed to catch this only looked at PDF reports; it now covers every export.

## v0.37.0 — 2026-08-17

The vendor released Highway Detail and Highway Summary, and this release takes
both the rest of the way: Highway Summary goes from export-only to fully
integrated, Highway Detail leaves pre-release, and a real data-loss bug in the
Highway Detail print converter is fixed.

### Added
- **Highway Summary consolidates, and compares both ways.** The last TSAR report
  without a consolidation now has one. Consolidating writes one row per route
  carrying the route's total mileage and all 95 category mileages (Highway Group,
  Access Control, Rural-Urban, Non-Add, Median Type/Barrier/Width, Number of
  Lanes, Terrain, Design Speed), plus a **Combined** sheet with the familiar
  section-by-section statewide rollup. The Compare tab gains both "Highway Summary
  — between environments" and "Highway Summary — TSMIS vs TSN", so **every report
  the app exports and consolidates is now also checked against TSN.**
- **The Highway Summary comparison says where the two systems differ in KIND,
  rather than quietly reconciling them.** Four categories show as one-sided
  instead of compared: `MEDIAN TYPE (UNDIVIDED)` and `(DIVIDED)` are group
  sub-headers the export writes as zero and the TSN print doesn't measure; the
  print has no `DESIGN SPEED - NO DATA` row; and `MEDIAN BARRIER Z- NO BARRIER`
  prints as `**********` because the figure overflows its column — a value the
  print doesn't state, not a zero. The comparison also warns that **TOTAL MILES
  SELECTED is not like-for-like**: the TSN print excludes non-add and
  unconstructed mileage by its own footnotes, and the export doesn't.
- **Highway Summary refuses a changed layout instead of guessing.** The report's
  sections and codes are checked against the released layout on every route, so a
  renamed section, a new or dropped code, or an over-precise value stops that
  route with a message naming what changed, rather than quietly producing a table
  that would compare clean against an equally-wrong one. Sections that tabulate
  less than the route total (the site's own classification — six routes
  statewide) have the untabulated remainder shown, never redistributed.
- **The TSN print's identity travels with the comparison** — report id, event,
  reference date and submitter are captured when the print is read and shown on
  the comparison, so it's always clear which pull the figures came from.
- **Highway Detail comparisons can now produce evidence images.** Evidence —
  the highlighted side-by-side crops of both systems' actual prints — was held
  back for Highway Detail while the report was pre-release. Now that it is
  released, its vs-TSN comparison joins the other four: a sampled difference
  renders the TSMIS print and the TSN district print side by side with the
  differing value boxed on each, every crop re-read and checked against the
  compared value. (The cross-environment lane does not carry Highway Detail
  evidence yet.)

### Fixed
- **Highway Detail (PDF) no longer loses the record on a single-record page.**
  A page holding exactly one record draws no shaded band, so the converter could
  not work out its columns, skipped the page, and marked the run incomplete —
  losing 13 records across 12 routes on a statewide export and making those
  routes look different from their own Excel export. The converter now reads the
  column positions from that page's own header rule, which the page's own layout
  draws. All 12 routes now convert with no warnings and match their Excel export
  row for row. Statewide, Highway Detail's PDF and Excel exports now line up on
  **51,327 locations with none missing from either side and 51,326 rows
  identical** — a single known record on route 395 still differs, and it is
  tracked as its own separate fix.

### Changed
- **Highway Detail is no longer pre-release.** The vendor's accidental enabling in
  July 2026 froze the report: its exports were not to be trusted as ground truth.
  The 2026-08-17 release supersedes that. The released export's layout is
  unchanged from what the app already reads (the same 34 columns), so Highway
  Detail's consolidation, comparisons and evidence are live against real data.
  Two known Highway Detail (PDF) parsing limits remain open and are called out in
  the project notes — they affect a handful of records on one route.

### Note
- **Compare like dates.** The TSN Highway Summary print supplied with this release
  is dated **09/15/2025**, and the newest Highway Summary export is 2026-08-17 —
  about eleven months apart, so most mileage has genuinely moved and 89 of the 92
  shared categories differ. That is real network change, not a fault in either
  system. To read the comparison as a correctness check rather than a record of
  drift, pull a TSN print close to the export's date.

## v0.35.1 — 2026-08-11

Exports work against the newer TSMIS form again, one-click updates tolerate the
brief Windows file lock seen during the last update, and generated folders keep
their internal bookkeeping out of the way.

### Fixed
- **Exports use the site's stable District/County/Route controls.** The newer
  form keeps two different controls labelled `District`, which made Playwright's
  label lookup ambiguous and stopped exports before generation. Report setup,
  preflight and route generation now use the form's structural IDs, while the
  existing flat and grouped report menus remain supported.
- **One-click updates recover from transient readiness-marker locks.** The first
  two v0.35.0 restart attempts reached the new helper but Windows briefly denied
  access to its readiness marker. Marker reads now retry within the existing
  15-second bound and still fail closed—terminating an unproven helper and
  leaving the old app open—if the exact nonce never becomes readable.

### Changed
- **Generated folders now separate internal state under `_state`.** Outcomes,
  provenance, comparison payloads and locks, fingerprints, evidence manifests,
  and Matrix caches no longer sit beside the workbooks, PDFs and images people
  use. Startup migrates only recognized legacy state, verifies each copy by
  SHA-256 before removing the old file, and retains conflicts instead of
  overwriting them. `.tsmis-owned.json` deliberately stays at an owned root as
  the deletion-safety marker.

### Internal
- Added browser coverage for the duplicate-label form, updater coverage for
  transient and persistent marker denial, and a dedicated output-state migration
  gate. The full offline suite now contains 159 checks.

## v0.35.0 — 2026-08-10

### Changed
- **Highway Sequence now compares every column.** `HG`, `City` and `Distance To
  Next Point` were context columns — shown but never counted. They are now
  compared like the rest, so a difference in them is a difference.

  Expect a lot more differences, for reasons that are structural rather than a
  disagreement about the highway: TSMIS leaves `HG` blank for entire counties
  while TSN always fills it (`U`/`D`), TSN assigns a city code far more
  aggressively than TSMIS, and `Distance To Next Point` is measured to each
  system's *own* next listed point — TSN lists finer breaks, so its gap is
  usually smaller. That reasoning is now printed on the workbook's Notes sheet
  instead of being used to suppress the count, so you can read those three
  columns for what they are.

  Only the vs-TSN comparison changes. The PDF-vs-Excel self-check already
  compared all three, because both of its sides are the same TSMIS render.

## v0.34.0 — 2026-08-10

Evidence images become a real spot check. Both panels are now crops of the
actual printed PDFs, so holding an image next to the comparison sheet can
catch a bad parse — which is the only reason the feature exists. Cross-
environment comparisons get evidence for the first time.

### Changed
- **Both sides of an evidence image are crops of the source prints.** One side
  used to be a panel drawn from the compared workbook. That was circular: the
  panel and the comparison sheet were built from the same read, so no amount of
  looking at it could catch a parsing mistake. Every panel is now a crop of an
  actual page — the per-route TSMIS PDF export and the TSN library print — with
  the red box on the compared cell and the caption naming the exact file and
  page number. You can open that page yourself and check it.
- **Evidence is collected for the four PDF-edition families only** — Highway
  Log, Highway Sequence, Intersection Detail and Ramp Detail — in three lanes
  each: Everything vs-TSN, By Day vs-TSN, and Everything cross-environment.
  Everywhere else the evidence toggle and the per-cell camera are gone and
  nothing is produced, because a crop needs a print on both sides. Highway
  Detail joins when its pre-release freeze lifts.

### Added
- **Cross-environment comparisons produce evidence images.** Comparing the same
  report across two environments previously had no evidence at all; both sides
  are per-route prints, so both crop cleanly.
- **A print that disagrees with the comparison is shown, with a note.** It used
  to be dropped in silence — which hid exactly the parser bug the spot check
  exists to find. The image now renders with the disagreement stated on it, and
  its subline says the print DISAGREES instead of claiming verification.
- **Normalization is disclosed on the image.** When the print's own text is a
  different form of the compared value — a two-digit year, a zero-padded width,
  a composite flag+date cell, a null marker — the image says so and quotes the
  print's token, so a reader is never left comparing `64-01-01` against
  `1964-01-01` and wondering.

### Fixed
- **Red boxes land on exactly one cell.** Ramp Detail's District box used to
  swallow neighbouring columns; a blank cell could be marked with a sliver of a
  box drawn past the end of the record's own printing, pointing at nothing. A
  blank is now boxed only where the record's own ink brackets the column, or —
  for the ruled Intersection Detail grid — at the print's own cell rectangle.
  Verified by reading every one of 341 images at full size: zero mis-targeted,
  wrong-record, multi-column, clipped or out-of-record boxes.
- **Stale evidence is retired instead of left looking current.** If a required
  print is missing when evidence is refreshed, the previous evidence workbook,
  image folder and manifest used to survive at their canonical names beside a
  comparison they no longer illustrated. They are now removed, and the run says
  why.
- **Captions, titles and notes are no longer cut off**, and the two captions in
  a side-by-side image no longer overprint each other.

## v0.33.1 — 2026-08-02

### Changed
- **The Clean Road build greys the headers of columns it cannot source.** On the
  built `CA HIGHWAYS` sheet, the columns no ArcGIS layer can fill — plus the
  TSN-internal bookkeeping ones — now carry the Provenance sheet's grey on their
  header cell, with a hover note naming the tier and pointing at Provenance. An
  empty column reads as "couldn't be sourced" instead of "the data went
  missing". This is the same disclosure principle as v0.33.0's Clean Road fix,
  applied to the build's own sheet: the Provenance sheet has been colour-coded
  since v0.31.0 and the comparison's context headers since v0.32.0, but the data
  sheet's own header row was still plain.

  Presentation only — cell VALUES, counts and every comparison result are
  untouched.

## v0.33.0 — 2026-08-02

The first two fix bundles from the post-comparison output audit: the Clean Road
workbook stops calling unreadable source data a difference, and every comparison
workbook is legible — no cut-off text anywhere — and says what it means.

### Fixed
- **The Clean Road comparison no longer publishes differences that aren't
  differences.** 102 of the ArcGIS as-of spans have a postmile the layer cannot
  resolve. The build used to skip them in silence, leaving the ArcGIS side blank
  at **165 cells** — and the comparison then coloured **161** of those red as
  "ArcGIS ≠ TSN" when the raw ArcGIS data actually agreed, while
  misrepresenting the 4 that genuinely differ. Those cells now carry an explicit
  unavailable marker, count as not-compared instead of a difference, and the
  workbook discloses all of it: Summary and Notes state the count and the reason,
  a marker sheet itemizes all 102 skipped spans, and a new **ArcGIS Marked
  Anchors** sheet names — per marked cell — the value that could not be placed,
  which layer it came from, and its one known postmile. Where a marker stands in
  front of two unplaceable values, it names both.
- **Text no longer gets cut off in the comparison workbooks.** Column widths were
  hard-coded guesses; they are now measured against what each cell will actually
  hold, in the font it renders in, across every sheet the workbook publishes —
  the Comparison key and field columns, both Only-in sheets, the data sheets,
  Routes, Provenance, Source Files, Spot Check and Summary. Sentences too long
  for any sensible column wrap in a row tall enough to show every line instead of
  being clipped; identity values are widened and never wrapped, because a
  truncated identity reads as a different value. Measured over every visible
  sheet of every deliverable: the old build produced **1,648,387** cut-off cells,
  the new one produces **zero**.
- **A column that is entirely context now says so.** *DIFFERENCES BY FIELD* used
  to print a bare `0` for it, which reads exactly like a compared column that
  happened to have no differences. It now reads `not compared (context)`.
  Per-cell context, like the Highway Log ditto columns, still reports real counts.
- **The values workbook publishes its own headline.** `Summary!B3` is written as
  a literal, so anything that reads the file without recalculating — openpyxl,
  pandas, any automated reader — sees the same verdict the app does. The live
  freshness guard now says `REGENERATE REQUIRED` in both twins rather than a
  generic `CHECK`.
- **Provenance names a file you can actually open.** When a comparison read its
  input through a verified private copy, the sheet used to record that temporary
  path — a directory deleted when the run ended. It now names the canonical
  source and adds `read via: …`, and the recorded digest is still that of the
  bytes actually read.
- **Stale capture directories are cleaned up.** A killed process could leave temp
  capture folders behind with nothing to unwind them; they are now swept, bounded
  by prefix, location, age and contents, and anything unexpected is left alone
  and logged.

### Internal
- **A new permanent gate, `check_workbook_presentation.py`.** It builds
  comparisons in both flavors and measures them with the audit's own oracle —
  imported, not reimplemented, so the shipped check and the audit cannot drift —
  covering every visible sheet, every column, every row. It also proves the
  identity-widened-never-wrapped rule, the context rendering, the published
  headline, and its agreement with the typed outcome.
- Clean Road canary re-blessed as **CRH-SW-E3**, superseding CRH-SW-E2's counts,
  with the exact input identities recorded.
- `backfill_release_notes.ps1 -WhatIf` previews through a real temp file.

### Known / owed
- **The work-PC acceptance run is still owed** and only the owner can do it — the
  dev box cannot reach the TSMIS intranet. This release changes what the
  comparison workbooks look like on purpose: re-run both sides rather than
  reconciling old output against new.
- Data-sheet columns are slightly wider than they strictly need to be — the
  sizing inherits openpyxl's own 13.0 default as a floor. It can only over-widen,
  never cut anything off; correcting it forces a full output regeneration, so it
  is deferred to a release that regenerates anyway.
- The `Report View` sheet declares no column widths, in this release and every
  release before it. It replicates a printed report, so fitting its columns would
  break the replication it exists to provide; it is measured, disclosed and
  unchanged rather than silently excluded.

## v0.32.0 — 2026-07-23

Marathon 2 (close-out): fast mode saves both formats in one pass, every
per-route file names its own run, and the Excel-side evidence gap is fixed.

### Added
- **Every per-route export file now carries its run identity in the name** —
  `2026-07-23 ssor-prod highway_log_route_3.xlsx` instead of the bare
  `highway_log_route_3.xlsx` — so a file copied out of its folder still says
  which day and which site produced it. Old exports keep working: a resumed run
  recognizes the old dateless names and skips those finished routes instead of
  downloading a second copy (which the consolidators would refuse as a
  duplicate). The Everything store keeps its environment-tag names, and file
  CONTENTS are untouched — the workbooks and PDFs stay exactly what the site
  produced.
- **Context columns are visibly distinct in the clean-road comparison** — the
  24 shown-but-never-counted columns now have grey headers with a hover note,
  so the full 74-column file reads at a glance which columns are counted and
  which are reference-only. Counts are unchanged (re-proven statewide against
  the blessed canary).

### Fixed
- **Fast mode no longer generates a report twice when both formats are
  selected** — picking a report's Excel AND PDF editions in fast mode now
  generates each route once and saves both files off that single render, the
  way the standard path has since v0.19.2 (roughly halving those runs). Matrix
  export buttons queueing both editions of a report for the same day get the
  same single pass.
- **Evidence images from the Excel side work for every compared column now.**
  The comparison names columns its own way (PM, PR, HG…) while the workbook
  uses the site's labels (Post Mile, PP, H/G…), so evidence silently skipped
  those columns — Intersection Detail lost 26 of its 35. Each report's evidence
  now resolves columns exactly the way its own comparison reads the workbook
  (and refuses honestly where no single cell holds the value, like derived
  columns). Verified against real statewide workbooks: 26,320 sampled cells,
  every one matching what the comparison compared.

## v0.31.0 — 2026-07-23

Marathon 2 (first part): a new PDF-vs-Excel matrix, the report-wiring made
future-proof, and the Clean Road comparison polish.

### Added
- **A "PDF vs Excel Matrix" tab** under Compare — rows are the five reports that
  export in both formats, columns are the export days you add, and each cell
  self-checks that day's PDF export against its Excel export (both consolidated
  from the same run folder, so the two sides are same-day by construction). Same
  controls as the other matrices: drag the rows and day columns, show/hide
  reports, build a cell or a whole row/column, open the workbook, live progress
  and ETAs. Comparisons land in `output/comparisons/pdf-vs-excel-by-day/`, named
  so two days can be open in Excel at once. A day needs BOTH editions exported;
  when only one is there the cell says so instead of guessing.
- **A Cancel button on the ArcGIS tab** — the clean-road build could already be
  stopped internally, but there was no way to ask; Build and Compare now also
  grey out while one is running.
- **The clean-road comparison Notes gain a column-match table** — for every
  column: the name (the same on the TSN extract and our build), the ArcGIS layer
  and source column it is built from, and whether it is counted as a difference
  or shown as context. So you can see what matched what.

### Changed
- **The clean-road build's Provenance sheet is colour-coded** — greyed for the
  columns no ArcGIS layer can fill (and the TSN bookkeeping ones left empty),
  blue for the ones derived from the overlay, plain for the ones painted from a
  layer.
- **The ArcGIS clean-road comparison auto-saves to `output/comparisons/arcgis/`**
  (beside the manual comparisons folder) instead of the build output folder;
  "Save elsewhere…" still works.

### Internal
- The per-report matrix wiring (which comparator each row uses, which format tag
  it carries) moved from four parallel hand-maintained lists into one table in
  the report catalog, and a new `check_report_wiring` gate fails by NAME when a
  report is missing a touchpoint — the "added a report, forgot one mirror" class
  that caused a field crash in v0.17.3. Behaviour is unchanged (proved
  cell-for-cell against the old lists).

### Known / owed
- Deferred to a follow-up, deliberately: single-pass dual-format export in fast
  mode + the date on every per-route filename (they change export/resume
  behaviour that can only be verified on the work PC), the Excel-side evidence
  column fix (root cause pinned — see the plan doc), and colouring the
  non-compared columns inside the clean-road comparison sheet (those columns are
  already all present).

## v0.30.0 — 2026-07-22

Marathon 1 of the owner's app-consistency backlog: the existing surfaces made
right, comparison observability, and the Edge sign-on diagnosis kit.

### Added
- **Comparison ETAs.** The matrices now show `Comparing 3/12 · 45s elapsed ·
  ~2m15s left` — the estimate comes from recent per-report durations (their
  median), refined by the current run; with no history yet it shows elapsed only
  rather than inventing a number. The completion summary reports total elapsed.
- **Detailed comparison logging.** Every matrix comparison logs a line per cell —
  a `▸ comparing …` start and a `✓/⚠/✗/■ … — done in Ns` outcome (successes
  included, not just failures) — so one log read reconstructs a whole run. A
  failed cell's reason now shows on the cell's hover tooltip (it was stored but
  never displayed), the durable attempt record gains the failing error type, and
  a standalone comparison logs both compared input paths.
- **Open the evidence images** for a built comparison straight from its matrix
  cell (a new button beside "open comparison"), independent of the toggle.
- **Draggable day columns** on the by-day and vs-Baseline matrices (rows and the
  Everything matrix's environment columns already dragged).
- **Retry Edge sign-in** button in the sign-in popover — re-runs the silent
  device sign-in on demand, the remedy when the saved session expired (no full
  sign-in needed). The Edge chip now also shows WHY a silent sign-in failed
  instead of just going dark.

### Changed
- **The Consolidate day picker lists only the days the selected report was
  actually exported** (it refilters as you change report), instead of every run
  folder.
- **The per-cell evidence camera is only offered when the Evidence images toggle
  is on** (and the grid updates live when you flip it) — the "collect" action is
  active exactly when the box is checked.
- **Comparison workbooks have unique, self-identifying names.** The by-day and
  vs-Baseline matrices embed the day + source (and baseline) in the filename, so
  two days' comparisons of the same report can be open in Excel at once (it
  refuses two workbooks with the same basename). Pre-v0.30 dateless cells read as
  not-built once and rebuild under the new name; cell CONTENT is unchanged.
- **Manual comparisons auto-save to `output/comparisons/manual/`** (a predictable
  home) instead of beside whatever file you picked; you can still redirect.
- **The `input/` folder is retired.** The TSN Highway Log combine feature reads
  its district PDFs straight from `tsn_library/highway_log/raw/` — the same
  folder the comparison and evidence already use — so there is ONE drop location.
  A combine run that finds PDFs still in the old `input/` folder points you to
  move them (never a silent fallback).
- **Clearer sign-in diagnostics.** A not-signed-in navigate now names the cause
  in the log (Microsoft interactive-auth stall vs off-site/network vs
  on-TSMIS-not-in-group), and the CDP re-attach + signed-in checks no longer
  swallow their errors silently.

## v0.29.1 — 2026-07-22

Two same-evening corrections to the new clean-road comparison, both at the
owner's direction.

### Changed
- **The ADT profile family is now compared and counted.** Profile, ADT and
  Change-per-mile were shown but left out of the difference counts while
  TSN's own per-row arithmetic remained partially unpinned. That was the
  wrong call: a column that disagrees wholesale is exactly the signal this
  comparison exists to surface — columns have been wrong before and were
  corrected because a report showed it. All three now count like any other
  column; the Notes name the two known model-fit classes a reader should
  keep in mind inside those counts (TSN's profiles continue across county
  lines where our build re-anchors, and where several count vintages are
  live TSN's pick isn't always the latest year). Change-per-mile compares at
  3 decimals so the extract's own 4th-decimal arithmetic wobble never counts.
- **City codes are now translated and compared.** The City layer carries
  city names where TSN carries the TASAS letter codes — so the app now ships
  a translation table DERIVED from the data itself: 21,906 statewide rows
  where a city span and the extract's coded rows co-locate voted name→code,
  with 99.92% agreement (the one sub-90% vote, Alhambra — whose boundary
  rows bleed into its neighbors — resolved to its clear majority). A name
  the table doesn't know passes through verbatim, so it surfaces as a
  visible difference instead of vanishing. The built workbook's Provenance
  sheet and the comparison Notes record the rule.

## v0.29.0 — 2026-07-22

### Added
- **The ArcGIS tab — build your own CA HIGHWAYS clean-road file and compare it
  against TSN.** Drop your per-layer ArcGIS exports (the agreed 40-layer
  library, one .xlsx per layer plus the export's own `00_INDEX.xlsx`) into
  `arcgis_layers/`, and the new tab shows exactly what's staged, what's
  missing, and anything it doesn't recognize. **Build from layers** rebuilds
  the vendor's 74-column CA HIGHWAYS table independently from those layers —
  slices selected as of the TSN extract's own date, keyed on county + postmile
  (never the odometers), with the independent-alignment R/L rows, the ADT
  profile interpolation, tolls/forest coding, landmarks, equates and route
  breaks all derived the way the extract carries them. **Compare vs TSN** then
  diffs the two cell-for-cell, in the same discrepancy-workbook format as
  every other comparison — live-formulas and values editions both.
- **Every column is indexed back to its source layer.** The built workbook
  carries a `Provenance` sheet naming, for each of the 74 columns, the layer
  and column it was painted from — including the FeatureServer source recorded
  by the export's own INDEX — and the comparison's Notes sheet repeats the
  full audit list. Columns with no TSMIS source (the federal-aid trio,
  maintenance service level, national lands, scenic freeway, the TASAS
  change-tracking flags, city code — the City layer carries names, not TASAS
  city codes) stay PRESENT in the comparison, shown with TSN's value beside
  our empty cell and never counted as a difference, exactly as decided. The
  synthesized offset pair and the ADT profile trio are painted and shown the
  same way — visible on both sides, not counted — until TSN's own per-row
  arithmetic for them (profiles that continue across county lines, the
  vintage choice where several are live) is pinned; the Notes say so in
  plain words.
- **The library gates itself.** The build refuses when a required layer is
  missing (naming it), when a file holds fewer rows than the export's own
  INDEX claims (a truncated export), or when a file matches no manifest layer
  — the drop-zone can't accumulate dead weight. A small measured tolerance
  accepts ArcGIS's own count/export race on healthy exports.
- **The TSN Clean Road Highway library slot is live.** The staged
  `CA HIGHWAYS` extract now normalizes (verbatim, with the freshness marker)
  so comparisons reuse it like every other TSN library report. Intersections
  and Ramps stay staged skeletons — Highway went first, and their builds
  follow the same pattern later.

### Fixed
- **Builder refusals keep their own words.** A TSN library slot that refuses
  to build (for example the staged Clean Road Intersection/Ramp slots) now
  reports its own message instead of a generic certificate error, and
  declining an overwrite reads as cancelled rather than an error.
- **A stale TSN pick from a previous install heals itself.** When an
  explicitly selected TSN workbook points at an app-owned path from an older
  install (`_tsn_input\…` or an old library path) and the file is gone, the
  matrix now falls back to the canonical library automatically and marks the
  cell "(old pick ignored)" — instead of blocking the comparison until the
  selection was cleared by hand. Every other selection stays strict.

## v0.28.2 — 2026-07-22

### Fixed
- **"Save support bundle…" now produces the same bundle as everything else.**
  The button built its own zip, so it quietly missed what the other two paths
  had: the credential redaction and final scan, and — as of v0.28.1 — the
  environment facts, the file inventory and the state records. It was the
  weakest bundle sitting behind the control people actually use, which matters
  most on a work PC where the command-line alternative isn't available. All
  three ways of producing a bundle now run the same code, and the button still
  records the things only a live session knows: which site and browser it was
  using and how it signed in.

## v0.28.1 — 2026-07-22

A diagnostics release, cut so the work-PC acceptance run on v0.28.0 produces a
bundle that can actually explain a problem. Nothing in the export, consolidation
or comparison engines changed — comparison output is identical to v0.28.0.

### Changed
- **The evidence bundle now answers a support question on its own.** "Collect
  evidence" used to gather the logs, run summaries and self-test output — enough
  to see that something failed, rarely enough to see why. It now also records
  the PC facts that no log line carries (whether Windows allows long paths on
  this machine, how much of the 260-character path limit your install has
  already spent, and the longest paths it found), a name-and-size-only listing
  of every file the app has produced, and the small JSON records that say what
  each workbook claims to be — whether it finished, whether it's trusted, and
  which files it was built from. That is the half of a problem report the logs
  could never show.

  What it still never contains is unchanged: your saved login, the sign-in
  profile, failure screenshots, your exported report data, the TSN inputs and
  library, or the compressed comparison data. Those files sit in the same
  folders the new listing walks, so the bundle matches records by exact name —
  a report workbook cannot be picked up by mistake, and the bundle's own
  manifest spells out what was and wasn't included.

## v0.28.0 — 2026-07-22

The comparison-perfection release. Every finding this project owns is closed;
comparison counts and evidence output intentionally differ from earlier
versions, so re-run both sides rather than reconciling a new run against an old
one. After updating, the TSN libraries rebuild once and PDF-sourced
consolidated workbooks re-consolidate once.

### Added
- **Evidence for the PDF-vs-Excel self check.** Comparing a report's two TSMIS
  editions against each other can now produce images like every other
  comparison: the PDF side as a highlighted page snippet, the Excel side as its
  own workbook cell. Turn Evidence images on and build the comparison.

### Changed
- **Excel comparisons are illustrated from the Excel export.** Evidence used to
  draw the TSMIS side of every comparison from the printable PDF edition, even
  when the comparison had read the Excel export — and it silently skipped any
  value where the two editions disagreed. So the differences most worth seeing,
  the ones the print doesn't carry at all, were exactly the ones that never got
  a picture. An Excel comparison now shows the workbook cell it actually
  compared, named down to the sheet and cell reference so you can open it and
  look. Excel-side runs are also much faster: they no longer open all 252
  companion PDFs to illustrate a workbook.
- **Every evidence set now says which comparison it belongs to.** A small
  `(evidence).json` record beside the comparison names the exact comparison,
  the source files the pictures were taken from, and every image it published.
  If you rebuild a comparison without regenerating the images, the leftover set
  is recognisable as belonging to the previous one instead of looking current.
- **Evidence images now come with a complete difference ledger.** The evidence
  workbook has a new **Ledger** sheet listing, for every compared column, how
  many differences the comparison counted, how many of those sit on a row that
  can be photographed on its own, how many sit inside a repeated postmile, plus
  the context, identical and one-sided cell counts and the whole row universe.
  The pictures illustrate that record — they no longer stand in for it. Each
  example also names the exact Comparison row, occurrence and state it came
  from, and the two source rows behind it, so a reviewer can jump straight from
  an image to the cell it proves.

### Fixed
- **Evidence images and their workbook can no longer disagree.** If the images
  folder was open when a refresh finished, you could end up with a new evidence
  workbook sitting beside the previous run's pictures. Both now publish
  together or neither does: the previous set stays exactly as it was and the
  new one is saved alongside with a note.
- **A run that finds nothing to illustrate now records that.** Previously, when
  a rebuilt comparison had nothing photographable, the old images were simply
  left where they were. The prior set is now retired and the run records what
  it found, so "nothing to illustrate" and "images were never generated" are
  no longer indistinguishable.
- **Evidence no longer says "no differing columns" when there are some.** When
  every difference in a column happened to sit at a postmile that repeats, the
  images step reported nothing to illustrate — which read as "the two systems
  agree". It now reports the column, the count, and why no single row could be
  photographed for it.
- **Evidence is checked against the comparison it illustrates.** Every candidate
  image is matched to the published cell it claims to show and is dropped unless
  the comparison independently agrees the cell differs and holds the same
  values. Previously the images were produced by re-reading the two reports a
  second time, so a reading mistake could show up identically in the comparison
  and in its "proof".
- **A broken export can no longer destroy a good consolidated workbook.** If a
  report had been consolidated successfully and you then re-ran it with one
  route's export damaged, the partial rebuild replaced the good workbook — the
  routes that had been in it were simply gone, and the comparison that followed
  diffed the reduced file. The consolidated workbook is now the last COMPLETE
  one: a rebuild that comes back incomplete keeps the good file untouched, saves
  what it managed to build beside it as a clearly-named `(attempt)` copy you can
  open, and tells you which exports to fix. Nothing is compared until the
  rebuild completes, so a stale-but-complete workbook is never quietly diffed
  against today's exports either. The first time you consolidate a report there
  is nothing to protect, so a partial first build still lands and is still
  flagged amber.
- **A rebuild that failed or was stopped no longer disappears from the grid.**
  Refreshing a comparison that then crashed, or that you cancelled, left the
  previous green cell exactly as it was the moment the grid redrew — the failure
  survived only as a line in the log. Each cell now remembers its last refresh
  attempt across restarts: the previous result stays visible and unchanged (it
  is still the last good answer), with a marked edge and a "last refresh failed
  / stopped / incomplete" note until a successful rebuild replaces it. The
  end-of-run message counts what actually happened — attempted, succeeded,
  failed, cancelled, incomplete — instead of reporting a cancelled cell as done.
- **Changed source files can no longer hide behind an unchanged timestamp.**
  Freshness compared file names, sizes and timestamps, so a route file replaced
  with different content of the same length and its timestamp put back looked
  untouched and the old "match / 0 differences" stayed green. Freshness now
  reads the files' actual content, with a per-file cache validated against a
  Windows change signal that a restored timestamp cannot fake, and which is not
  trusted for a file that changed in the last second — measured on a full
  statewide export folder, this costs about as much as the old check once warm.
  The same fix applies to the cached TSN print used for evidence images. The
  first refresh after updating re-checks every report once.
- **A comparison workbook that could not be read is now refused instead of
  saved.** A comparison whose sheet was missing its `Status`/`Diffs` columns —
  or had no rows at all while reporting rows — could still replace a good
  workbook and then read as an empty, unusable result in the matrix. Such a
  workbook is now rejected at save time with a clear message, and the previous
  file is kept.
- **Comparisons now publish from any install folder — the 260-character Windows
  path limit no longer hides them.** The v0.27.0 field failure (every by-day
  comparison built its workbook and then vanished from the matrix) came down to
  one filename: each comparison stores its trust metadata in a content-addressed
  sidecar whose name was ~167 characters, so at a normal install depth the full
  path passed 260 characters. A managed work PC cannot lift that limit, the
  metadata write was refused, and the matrix — correctly — declined to show a
  comparison it could not certify. The workaround was moving the whole app to a
  short path like `C:\TSMIS`. The sidecar names now carry 16-character
  abbreviations of their two digests instead of the full 64 (the full digests
  are still recorded and verified inside the metadata itself, so nothing about
  integrity checking changed), which keeps the deepest published path well under
  the limit at the real install depth. Existing comparisons written under the
  old long names remain fully readable; the next rebuild of a comparison simply
  publishes under the short names. The moved-to-`C:\TSMIS` workaround is no
  longer necessary, and the release gate now proves the fix unconditionally —
  including on machines where long paths are allowed and the old test could
  never fail.

## v0.27.4 — 2026-07-21

### Fixed
- **A rebuilt TSN report stayed "consolidated STALE" forever.** Rebuilding the
  Highway Log library succeeded every time — 380 files, 60,083 rows, nothing
  skipped or failed — and the report still read out of date one second later, so
  "rebuild it" was advice that could never work. The library build writes an
  authoritative build record holding the normalizer version, the raw-source
  manifest and two identity bindings, and verifies it. The consolidation driver
  then wrote its own generic build record **over** it, which cannot reconstruct
  any of those four facts — so the normalizer version vanished and the freshness
  check correctly refused a record that no longer had one. Comparisons were
  already exempt from that second write; the TSN library build is now exempt on
  the same basis. Any producer that publishes its own verified record keeps it.

  After updating, rebuild each affected TSN report **once** — the stale reading
  was the record, not the workbook, and this time it will clear and stay clear.

## v0.27.3 — 2026-07-21

### Fixed
- **"Built by an older normalizer" now says which versions.** A Highway Log
  rebuild that completed cleanly — 380 files, 60,083 rows, nothing skipped or
  failed — still reported the report as out of date, in the same second, and
  again after a restart. "Rebuild it" is useless advice when a rebuild has just
  run. That verdict is a single yes/no built from two numbers that were never
  shown: the normalizer version recorded when the library was built, and the
  version this app expects. Both are reported now, and three cases that used to
  read identically are distinguished — a genuinely older stamp ("built by
  normalizer version 3, this app expects 5"), a build record carrying no version
  at all, and a version stored in an unusable form. No freshness logic changed;
  the same libraries are current as before.

## v0.27.2 — 2026-07-21

### Fixed
- **A TSN report that isn't current now says why.** "consolidated STALE" was one
  word covering eight independent conditions, so a library that had never been
  built, one built by a superseded normalizer, one whose raw files had changed,
  and one whose build record no longer matched its workbook all looked identical
  — and none of them said what to do. Reported from the field: a Highway Log
  rebuild that completed cleanly (380 files, 60,083 rows, nothing skipped or
  failed) still read STALE afterwards, with no way to tell why from the panel.
  The freshness check already decided every condition separately and simply
  discarded the answer at the display boundary. Each report now reports the first
  failing condition, in plain terms and with the action it implies, on the panel
  and in the log. **No freshness logic changed** — exactly the same libraries are
  current as before; only the explanation is new.

### If the vs-TSN matrix shows no comparisons
Unchanged from v0.27.1, repeated because it is the most likely thing you will
hit: comparison workbooks build correctly but the matrix hides them when their
trust metadata cannot be written, and the usual cause is the Windows
260-character path limit. This is now confirmed from a real install
(`path_len=265`). **Move the app to a shorter folder path** — for example
`C:\TSMIS\TSMIS Exporter\` — and re-run. The comparison workbooks themselves are
valid and readable under `output\comparisons\tsn-by-day\` in the meantime. A
permanent fix that shortens the internal file name is in progress.

## v0.27.1 — 2026-07-21

Diagnoses the v0.27.0 field failure where **every comparison built but never
appeared on the matrix**, and fixes four smaller things reported alongside it.

### If your comparisons stopped appearing on the matrix — read this
The comparison workbooks were built correctly and are still on disk; only the
trust metadata beside them failed to publish, and the matrix refuses to show a
comparison it cannot certify. You can open the workbooks directly under
`output\comparisons\tsn-by-day\`.

The likely cause is the **Windows 260-character path limit**. v0.27.0 writes a
content-addressed sidecar whose file name is long, so on a deep install path —
for example under `Downloads\Apps\…` — the full path can exceed 260 characters.
A PC without long-path support (the default on managed machines, and not
changeable without an administrator) refuses the write, and v0.27.0 reported that
only as "could not be safely published".

**The workaround is to move the app to a shorter folder path** — something like
`C:\TSMIS\TSMIS Exporter\` — and re-run the comparison.

This release does **not** yet shorten the sidecar name; that changes a persisted
format and is being done separately with a full re-verification. What it does is
make the failure name itself, so the log now says exactly which file failed, how
long its path was, and what to do about it.

### Fixed
- **Comparison publication failures are diagnosable.** Every fail-closed gate in
  the publication path — about seventeen of them — used to return silently, so a
  field failure left nothing in the log. Each now names the gate it stopped at
  and prints the values that decided it (which member, which phase, the
  before/after sha256, size and mtime, and the full path with its length). A
  refusal caused by the path limit says so and names the remedy. No gate changed
  what it accepts or refuses; only the refusal became answerable.
- **The TSN reports panel stayed STALE after a rebuild.** The panel refreshed
  only when its own Rebuild button started the work. The comparison matrix
  rebuilds an out-of-date TSN dataset on its own before comparing, and that path
  never triggered the refresh — so Highway Log and Highway Sequence kept reading
  STALE until the app was restarted. The refresh now follows the rebuild
  finishing, whoever started it.

### Added
- **Rebuild all out of date** (Settings ▸ TSN reports). After an update moves a
  normalizer version, every affected report reads out of date and had to be
  rebuilt one at a time. The new button does them in a single run, targeting
  exactly the reports the per-report Rebuild would, and reports the first failure
  rather than the last result so an early failure cannot hide behind a later
  success. Nothing out of date disables the button instead of reporting an error.
- **The TSN panel reports evidence prints too.** A report can need two separate
  things: the raw files its consolidated workbook is built from, and the TSN
  prints the evidence images are cropped from. The panel only showed the first,
  so "all green" said nothing about whether evidence could render. Each report
  now also reports its prints — present, missing, or covered by the same raw it
  already builds from (Highway Log and Highway Sequence, which never need a
  second copy).
- **The background sign-in check announces itself.** On startup the app quietly
  checks the saved sign-in, and that check holds the single-task slot — so a
  click during it was refused with "try again in a few seconds" and no visible
  reason. It now says when it starts and when it finishes.

## v0.27.0 — 2026-07-19

Evidence images become configurable, and the comparison engine lands the first
large batch of the source-first correctness audit — 219 of 241 findings closed
across the comparison, matrix, TSN-normalization and PDF-identity paths. **Several
comparisons now report different — more correct — numbers than v0.26.2**, and the
TSN libraries rebuild once on first use. Read "After updating" at the end of this
section before reconciling anything against an older run.

### Added
- **Pick the evidence image layout.** The evidence controls on both comparison
  matrices (vs TSN and by-day) carry a layout dropdown beside the "generate
  images" toggle: **side by side** (the default), **stacked**, or **both**. Only
  the layout(s) you pick are rendered — choosing one instead of both roughly
  halves the image count and the render time for a large evidence set. The choice
  persists across runs and is captured when a job is queued, so changing it
  mid-queue can't retarget work already in flight.
- **The evidence workbook splits its examples by comparison column.** Instead of
  one combined sheet of every sampled difference, the workbook now opens one tab
  **per comparison column** (Description, Length, ADT…), each holding just that
  column's examples. Sheet names are de-duplicated and legal, and the Summary tab
  lists which layouts were rendered.

### Changed — comparison results change
These are corrections, not regressions: each was proved cell-for-cell against an
independent oracle and both workbook flavors on the real statewide corpus. Counts
that differ from a v0.26.2 run differ because the old number was wrong.
- **Highway Sequence pairs on physical identity, and "PM Suffix" is a compared
  column.** PDF↔Excel rows now pair on route/county/prefix/base postmile with the
  suffix asserted rather than folded, making the statewide corpus exact:
  60,493 paired / 0 PDF-only / 1 Excel-only.
- **Highway Sequence Descriptions compare verbatim.** The old symmetric strip rule
  removed text the TSN extract genuinely carries (including its 154 numeric
  prefixes); TSMIS strips only its own-route label. Both sides are now compared as
  printed.
- **Duplicate rows are assigned by a typed, auditable objective.** When a key
  matches several rows, occurrences are paired by minimizing an approved
  source-identity tuple (compared-field differences, then character edit distance,
  then position gap) instead of file order — context and ditto cells decide *which*
  occurrences correspond, while verdicts and counts stay assertion-only. Above the
  100,000-cell cap the output is explicitly partial diagnosis and can never read
  green.
- **The TSN Highway Log and Highway Sequence normalizers were rebuilt from raw
  source.** Highway Log v5 keys detached suffixed-route group headers ("07 LA 005 S")
  as the suffixed route — 317 statewide rows are no longer misattributed — and
  conserves asterisk-leading printed Descriptions (four statewide rows that were
  each a manufactured false difference). Highway Sequence v4 is source-exact at
  69,804 rows including the 46 blank-county equates and 565 pointer tokens.
- **A PDF's own route claim is authoritative.** All five PDF converters and the
  evidence adapters read identity from the document itself (page banners, the
  Intersection Detail cover parameter, the Highway Log cover line) instead of
  inferring it from the filename, and refuse duplicate or blank route claims by
  naming both source PDFs. Verified refusal-free across all 1,099 statewide
  per-route documents.
- **PDF-vs-Excel self-checks project both sides verbatim.** The same-source flavors
  no longer rewrite values for display — Highway Detail surfaces "PM (raw)" and
  verbatim NA, Highway Log surfaces "Location (raw)", and Intersection Detail's
  J→S fold is gone — so a self-check reports what the two files actually say.
- **Ramp Detail postmiles are canonical.** `9.6`, `9.600` and `009.600` are one
  ramp for physical identity (statewide census: zero pairing changes, 1,755
  display texts canonicalized), and the vs-TSN loader decodes the Excel export's
  OOXML escapes so encoding artifacts stop reading as data differences.

### Fixed
- **Evidence images no longer invent differences.** Every adapter now enumerates
  differences through the comparison's own `compared_cell` decision, so
  Excel-trimmed whitespace, Med-Wid equivalents and context/ditto cells can't be
  sampled as diffs.
- **Evidence is bound to the exact PDFs it was rendered from.** Candidate PDFs are
  digested before parsing and re-verified before publishing, so a same-size,
  same-timestamp file swap mid-render aborts instead of shipping mismatched images.
- **A clean rebuild retires its stale evidence.** When a rebuilt comparison has no
  differing columns, the previous run's red evidence workbook and image folder are
  removed instead of being left behind to look current.
- **The evidence workbook and its images publish as one set.** If the workbook is
  locked (open in Excel), the images divert alongside it, so you can never end up
  with a new workbook pointing at old images or the reverse.
- **Matrix and by-day cells report honestly.** Real day-folder identity and source
  reconciliation, a locked running-day removal, an accurate consolidation badge,
  correctly scoped rebuilds, a both-missing state, and the captured run date
  threaded end to end. Caches invalidate on a semantic producer version, and
  formula twins are bound to the generation that produced them.
- **Compare-tab dispatch matches what the buttons promise.** One shared
  buildability predicate behind the bulk selector, the explicit Build button and
  the queue; canonical TSN consolidate routing by origin; a Cancel lock on the
  Compare sub-tab; a queue-capable day export; and classic comparison inputs bound
  to their recipe with a preflight.
- **An auth or browser failure keeps runnable offline jobs** in the queue instead
  of clearing them.
- **A folder comparison refuses a run-root vs its own report-subfolder alias**
  (statewide census: zero false rejections).
- **The Highway Log PDF parser recovers asterisk-leading Descriptions** — the
  mirror of the TSN fix — dropping the statewide Description difference class from
  5 to 1.
- **Spot Check matches rows independently.** It key-token-matches both source rows
  itself and flags any disagreement with the Comparison sheet's stored links or
  status, so a forged row link reads CHECK.

### After updating
- **The TSN libraries rebuild once** on first use (Highway Sequence v4, Highway Log
  v5, Ramp Detail v5, Intersection Detail v5, Highway Detail v3). The vs-TSN
  comparisons refuse a pre-current library with a rebuild hint rather than
  comparing against stale normalization.
- **PDF-sourced workbooks made before this version re-consolidate once** — every
  PDF-sourced workbook now carries a conversion marker that the TSMIS (PDF)
  comparison role requires and the TSMIS (Excel) role rejects.
- **Don't reconcile this version's comparison counts against a v0.26.2 run.**
  Re-run both sides on this version first; the differences listed above are
  intentional corrections.

## v0.26.2 — 2026-07-10

### Fixed
- **Highway Log (PDF) days no longer read "inputs incomplete" for a routine
  print artifact.** A Highway Log print page whose only data rows are unshaded
  carries no cell-rectangle band of its own (plain zebra-row parity, ~280 pages
  per statewide export), so the parser reads it with the previous page's column
  geometry — and since v0.19.0 ANY such page conservatively marked the whole
  consolidation partial, which turned every Highway Log (PDF) matrix cell amber
  ("inputs incomplete") even though nothing was missing. The carry is now
  VALIDATED per page instead of blanket-flagged: every printed token's
  characters must land inside one column window (the same char-center test the
  parser assigns by) and the row's Location cell must still be a clean postmile
  token. A validated page is ordinary output (an info line reports the count);
  only a page whose text genuinely does not fit the carried geometry — a
  changed table layout — keeps the ⚠ warning and the partial flag. Verified
  statewide on two full export sets (551 carried pages, all validated; emitted
  rows byte-identical to the previous parser on every affected route; both
  end-to-end consolidations complete). After updating, force one re-consolidate
  per amber day column (the day header's consolidate badge) — the cell then
  clears to its real green/red.

## v0.26.1 — 2026-07-10

### Fixed
- **Evidence images: invisible quote-character differences are now labeled.** A
  difference whose two values differ only in quote characters — a doubled apostrophe
  (`''F'' ST`) on one side vs a real quotation mark (`"F" ST`) on the other — prints
  near-identically, so the evidence header looked like it flagged two equal values
  (field report: the Intersection Detail Description at KER 046 @ 50.904, the single
  such row statewide). The difference is real — the systems genuinely store different
  characters — and the image header now says so on a dark-red third line naming both
  sides' characters in words; the evidence workbook captions carry the same note. The
  Intersection Detail comparison's Notes sheet documents that quote characters compare
  literally (both systems share the `''X''` convention on every other quoted-letter row,
  so no normalization is applied — folding would hide a genuine data edit).

## v0.26.0 — 2026-07-10

Ramp Detail (PDF) — the last export-only print edition — is now fully integrated:
it consolidates, compares against TSN and against its own Excel edition, lives in
both matrices, and renders evidence images. Blessed on the first real work-PC print
set (`All Reports 7.9`, 126 routes): every one of its 15,216 rows parses back
row-for-row against the same-day Excel exports. This release also adds a third
comparison matrix — **vs Baseline** — that diffs any exported day of a report
against an earlier pull of the same report, and fixes the evidence images'
cropped snippets.

- **New: the "vs Baseline Matrix"** (Compare tab, beside the vs TSN Matrix). Rows =
  all 12 comparison-integrated reports, columns = exported days you add, each cell =
  that day's export compared against a **baseline** you pick — an earlier day's run
  folder, or the Export-Everything store — for the same source. Same format on both
  sides by construction (Excel vs Excel, PDF vs PDF: each row reads its own report
  subdir on both sides). The baseline picker shows how many reports each candidate
  day holds ("2026-06-11 · 9/12 reports"), missing copies render per cell, and the
  baseline's own column is marked. No consolidation and no TSN dataset needed — the
  per-route files are read straight from both folders, exactly like the classic
  cross-environment compare, and each cell writes the same discrepancy workbook
  (optionally with a live-formulas copy) into
  `output/comparisons/baseline-by-day/`. Switching baselines never clobbers another
  baseline's comparisons — each is its own artifact.
- **Evidence images no longer crop the interesting part.** Each snippet is now a
  full-width band of the page instead of a crop hugged to the record's own text —
  previously a difference on a BLANK cell could have its red box clipped off the
  image's edge (Highway Sequence showed it most), and neighbor rows' longer text
  was cut mid-word. Verified on 99 regenerated examples across Highway Sequence and
  Ramp Detail, both layouts; all five evidence reports inherit the fix.
- **New: one-click website source capture** (Settings ▸ "Capture website source").
  Signs in with the saved session, opens the current site's report page, and saves
  the rendered page, the raw HTML, and every same-origin script/stylesheet into a
  dated folder under `output/site-capture/` with a manifest — the manual
  devtools ▸ Sources download walk, automated. The capture is local diagnostic
  data for the maintainer; the app never bundles or uploads it.
- **Highway Detail (PDF) parses the July-2026 prints completely.** On the first
  real prod print set, three record shapes the parser had never seen dropped 254
  records as "unpaired lines" (the consolidation went partial): rows whose roadbed
  blocks carry codes but no effective dates, rows whose printed date lands across
  a shifted column grid, and outdented equate descriptions that START with a
  postmile-shaped token (each previously orphaned the real record and minted a
  phantom one). All three parse now and a record that genuinely prints no
  attribute line would be kept with blank attribute columns instead of dropped.
  Re-verified statewide on the same 252-print set: the consolidation completes
  cleanly (0 unpaired lines, was 254 + partial), 50,171 of 50,730 matched rows
  fully identical to the same-day Excel export, and the leftover one-sided rows
  fell from an unattributable 1,273 to 1,019 — nearly all the new sparse
  attribute-only rows at repeated postmiles, where the two renders' duplicate-row
  pairing differs; each is listed on the workbook's "Only in …" sheets.

- **TSMIS Ramp Detail (PDF) consolidator.** Parses the per-route prints into the
  Excel export's exact column layout — plus the two columns the print carries that
  the **Excel export drops**: the On/Off indicator and the Ramp Type letter. The
  print also renders empty fields visibly ("-" marks and a "NO RAMP LINEAR EVENT"
  message on the 59 statewide ramp points without linework) where the Excel leaves
  blanks; values are kept verbatim in the workbook and projected at compare time.
- **Two new comparison flavors.** TSMIS (PDF) vs TSN — where On/Off and Ramp Type
  are actually COMPARED against TSN's database (the Excel edition has nothing to
  compare there; ~151 more verified cells statewide) — and TSMIS (PDF) vs TSMIS
  (Excel), the internal consistency check: on the same-day statewide pair,
  **15,212 of 15,216 ramps fully identical, zero one-sided** — the only 4
  differing cells are literal "_x000d_" line-break escapes the Excel carries and
  the print omits.
- **Evidence images for both Ramp Detail rows.** The statewide TSN Ramp Detail
  print (500 pages) is indexed once and each differing cell renders as highlighted
  snippets from both prints, parse-back-verified (the TSN template censused
  400/400 records against the raw extract). The TSN Ramp Detail library gains
  District/County evidence columns (normalization v3 — rebuilds itself on next
  use).
- Matrix rows in BOTH matrices (cross-env / vs TSN / vs TSMIS Excel), the
  Consolidate-tab + console-menu entries, and the picker/coalescing behavior
  carried over unchanged.

## v0.25.2 — 2026-07-09

Hotfix for a field crash: exporting both editions of a report together (outside fast
mode) crashed immediately with "TypeError: expected str, bytes or os.PathLike object,
not NoneType" — before the browser even opened.

- **Coalesced exports work from the plain Export tab again.** Selecting an
  Excel + PDF pair of one report in a normal (sequential) export crashed while
  working out the output folders; the bug had been latent since coalescing shipped in
  v0.19.2 because fast mode runs editions separately and Export Everything supplies
  its own folders — a plain paired export was the one path that tripped it. Each
  edition now falls back to its dated run folder exactly like a single-report export.
  Locked by a new regression test.

## v0.25.1 — 2026-07-09

Every enabled report now exports in BOTH formats the site offers, and the site's
brand-new Route History Table shows up in the picker (greyed) so you know it exists.

- **TSAR: Ramp Summary (Excel).** Ramp Summary was the one report the app could only
  save as a PDF — yet the site's action bar has always had an Export button for it.
  It's now wired: a new "Summary (Excel)" edition under the Ramp group saves the same
  count tables as a per-route workbook. Selecting both Ramp Summary editions generates
  each route once and saves both files off it, like every other edition pair.
- **Intersection Summary (PDF).** The last report without a print edition gets one: a
  new "Summary (PDF)" edition under the Intersection group captures the site's own
  Print layout (cover page + the count tables) as a portrait Letter PDF, matching how
  the other five print editions mirror their Excel siblings. Coalesces with the Excel
  edition too.
- **Route History Table appears — greyed.** The TSMIS dev site added a "Route History
  Table" report on 2026-07-09. It isn't exportable (on the site it's an embedded
  report-server page with no export control), so the app lists it greyed in the picker
  — you can see the site gained it, and the moment the site gives it an export path a
  future update can turn it on without re-plumbing anything.
- Both new editions are export-only for now (their siblings already consolidate and
  compare the same data); they appear in Export Everything automatically.

## v0.25.0 — 2026-07-09

The Highway Sequence Listing (PDF) edition grows up — parser, comparisons, matrix row,
and evidence images, all verified against the first real statewide print set — and the
Intersection Summary consolidator absorbs the site's July rename before it could
mis-count anything in the field.

- **Highway Sequence (PDF) is fully integrated.** The print edition added in v0.24.0
  now consolidates ("TSMIS Highway Sequence (PDF)" on the Consolidate tab and in the
  console menu), compares, and appears as its own row in BOTH matrices with the full
  three modes: cross-environment, vs TSN, and vs TSMIS Excel. The parser was
  censused-first against the entire 252-route statewide set from a real work PC and
  parses back against the Excel edition at 60,493/60,493 rows — every residual
  difference class is explained and documented in the comparison's Notes sheets.
- **The print catches what the Excel export drops.** The statewide census found a
  location whose Description the Excel export silently omits while the print carries it
  (route 037 at postmile 003.809) — exactly the defect class the PDF↔Excel self-check
  exists to surface, and the same reason the Highway Log's PDF edition was born.
- **The PDF edition actually pairs BETTER against TSN.** The site's print renders
  equate points the same way TSN's own prints do (an "EQUATES TO …" annotation row plus
  the "E" suffix on the equated postmile), so the Excel edition's by-design "H ≠ blank"
  feature-type class largely disappears: statewide, 434 more locations match and ~600
  fewer cells differ than the Excel-vs-TSN comparison. Each flavor's Notes sheet
  explains its own by-design classes.
- **Evidence images for the Highway Sequence.** Both Highway Sequence rows can now
  render sampled vs-TSN differences as highlighted snippets from both PDFs — the same
  parse-back-verified workflow as Highway Detail, Intersection Detail and Highway Log.
  No new drop folder: the TSN side reads the SAME district prints your TSN Highway
  Sequence library is already built from (`tsn_library/highway_sequence/raw`), so if
  your vs-TSN comparison works, evidence is ready today.
- **Intersection Summary survives the July site update.** The site renamed one block
  header ("MAINLINE MASTARM" → "MAINLINE MASTERARM"), which silently emptied that block
  and mis-filed its "no data" count under Lanes when consolidating a fresh export. The
  parser now accepts both spellings (all workbook text keeps the original), verified on
  a fresh 217-route statewide export. And because that failure was silent, the
  consolidator gained a tripwire: every category block must sum to the route's total
  intersections (they all do, statewide, in both eras — except Highway Group, which the
  site itself under-counts and is exempt), so a future renamed header or brand-new code
  fails loudly with the block named instead of writing wrong numbers.

## v0.24.0 — 2026-07-09

Highway Log joins the evidence-images club, two new PDF print editions arrive, every
vs-TSN comparison got a standards audit against fresh statewide data, and the evidence
toggle now explains itself report by report.

- **Evidence images for the Highway Log.** Both Highway Log rows (Excel and PDF-sourced)
  can now render sampled vs-TSN differences as highlighted snippets from both PDFs —
  the same parse-back-verified workflow as Highway Detail and Intersection Detail,
  ditto-aware (a `+`-run "see paired roadbed" cell is never sampled, exactly as the
  comparison never counts it). No new drop folder: the TSN side reads the SAME district
  prints your TSN Highway Log library is already built from (`tsn_library/highway_log/raw`),
  so if your vs-TSN comparison works, evidence is ready today. The TSMIS side illustrates
  from the Highway Log (PDF) export, like the other reports.
- **Two new print editions: Highway Sequence Listing (PDF) and TSAR: Ramp Detail (PDF).**
  The same on-site reports as their Excel siblings, saved via the site's own Print layout
  (portrait for the Sequence Listing, landscape for Ramp Detail — matching their TSN
  prints). Ticking an Excel + PDF pair still generates each route once and saves both
  files. Export-only for now: their print-layout consolidators, comparisons, and evidence
  come once real work-PC PDFs verify the parse (the same staged path Highway Detail took).
- **The evidence toggle is no longer a mystery switch.** Both matrix pages now list, under
  the toggle, exactly what it will do: a ✓ line per report whose TSN prints are in place
  ("will generate"), a ○ line naming the exact drop folder for one that isn't, and one
  line naming the reports with no evidence support at all. Supported rows also carry a
  small camera badge on their row header (lit = ready, dimmed = tooltip names the folder),
  so you can tell at a glance — before running anything — which comparisons get images.
- **Comparison audit against fresh statewide data.** The Highway Sequence Listing
  comparison was re-verified end-to-end on a fresh 2026-07-08 statewide export (252
  routes): the TSN district-print parser reproduces the installed library byte-for-byte,
  and every count lands within a hair of the blessed baseline (the deltas are exactly the
  ~54 locations TSMIS added since June). A census of its differing cells confirmed the
  known classes — no new artifacts. Its Notes sheet now also explains why nearly all FT
  differences are the by-design "EQUATES TO" pairings.
- **Ramp Detail comparison hardening.** Its notes are now a proper Notes sheet in the
  workbook (key, normalizations, why the four TSN-only columns are context-only); a
  stale TSN library can no longer feed unnormalized postmiles/dates through the
  comparison (they re-normalize at compare time, proven a no-op on a fresh library across
  15,410 real rows); and the consolidated-workbook gate also checks width, not just the
  PM label. Ramp Summary's familiar sheet gained its own notes (the P/V dummy classes and
  the TSMIS-only footnote). No comparison numbers change.
- **Small clarity fixes everywhere.** A disabled "Create comparison…" button now says why
  on hover; the (PDF) editions in the report picker explain what a print edition is; and
  the Compare tab's "What you'll get" mentions the evidence-image workflow and where it
  lives.

## v0.23.0 — 2026-07-08

- **Evidence images on demand — no re-compare.** Every built, up-to-date vs-TSN cell of an
  evidence-capable report (Highway Detail, Intersection Detail) now has a camera action on both
  matrix pages: it generates — or refreshes — the "… (evidence).xlsx" and image folder for that
  cell's EXISTING comparison, without re-running the comparison and regardless of the "Evidence
  images" toggle. Use it when you compared with the toggle off, want a different example count,
  or just dropped the TSN prints in.
- **It refuses to lie.** If the exports, the consolidated workbook, or the TSN workbook changed
  since the comparison was built, the action declines with a "refresh the comparison" message
  instead of rendering images for a diff set the workbook doesn't carry. The camera only appears
  on fresh cells of reports whose TSN prints are in place.

## v0.22.1 — 2026-07-08

- **Both image layouts in the evidence workbook.** "… (evidence).xlsx" now carries two image
  tabs — **Evidence (stacked)** for reading top-to-bottom and **Evidence (side-by-side)** for
  copying straight into a report — instead of stacked-only (the side-by-side files previously
  lived only in the images folder). Applies to both Highway Detail and Intersection Detail
  evidence sets; the workbook grows accordingly (both layouts embedded).

## v0.22.0 — 2026-07-08

Intersection Detail catches up with the site's July 2026 report overhaul — and gets evidence
images, the second report after Highway Detail.

- **The new Intersection Detail format is fully supported.** The site's July 2026 update reshaped
  the report (35 columns: the duplicated second "ML Eff-Date" is gone; the tail is now
  "Xing P/S" + "Xing Line Lgth"; postmiles print zero-padded; booleans are Y/N; the print gained
  cover pages and per-record intersection numbers). The Excel consolidator, the PDF consolidator,
  and all three comparison flavors (vs TSN, PDF vs TSN, PDF vs Excel) now read that format —
  verified statewide against a same-run 217-route export pair (16,459 rows; PDF↔Excel
  cell-identical apart from whitespace the comparison already normalizes).
- **Pre-update workbooks and PDFs are refused, not mis-read.** The old 36-column layout can't be
  read by the new positions without silently mis-mapping every column from Description on, so the
  comparators and the PDF parser detect it and say to re-export instead. Consolidated workbooks
  and comparison results produced before the update remain readable as they are.
- **The comparison itself got dramatically cleaner** — the site fixed most of what used to differ
  wholesale. Date of Record and the INT/Control/Lighting effective dates now match TSN on ≥99.9%
  of rows (the old systematic ~1-day offset is gone), booleans match natively, the Location now
  carries the route suffix, and the cross-street completeness gap shrank from ~37% to ~1%. The
  one wholesale-structural column left is **Int St Eff-Date** (TSN stores a 2022 bulk refresh
  stamp where TSMIS now keeps the historical date), plus a smaller ML/CS eff-date resurvey gap
  (~12% / ~3%). "Xing Line Lgth" (TSN's X_CROSS_OVERRIDE) is newly exported and newly compared;
  the second ML eff-date TSMIS no longer exports appears TSN-only (blue) on the Report View. The
  statewide baseline drops from ~163k differing cells to **21,675** (16,199 matched
  intersections), and the Notes sheet was rewritten to describe the new reality.
- **Report View "Major" counts follow the data now.** Date of Record and INT/Control/Lighting
  eff-date differences count as Major (they're genuine conflicts now); Int St / ML / CS Eff-Date
  and the route suffix stay red-but-not-Major (structural). All differences still render red and
  count in "Diffs".
- **Evidence images for Intersection Detail.** The same verified screenshot-and-circle automation
  Highway Detail got in v0.21.0 now covers both Intersection Detail rows. Drop the **statewide
  TSN Intersection Detail print** (one PDF — any filename) into the TSN library's
  `intersection_detail/pdf/` folder (the app creates it), keep the day's "Intersection Detail
  (PDF)" export alongside the Excel one, and the shared "Evidence images" option covers this
  report too. The TSN side of every example is located on the print's fixed column template —
  validated statewide (16,584/16,584 records; 30 of 32 columns parse back 100.0% identical to
  the TSN extract, the rest are print truncations the verifier correctly skips). The matrix
  option's hint now reports each report's PDF folder separately.
- Rebuild the TSN library once after updating (the app prompts): the stored Intersection Detail
  projection moves to the new shape and records each row's district/county for evidence.

## v0.21.1 — 2026-07-08

Hotfix: the folder v0.21.0's release notes told you to drop the TSN district PDFs into now
actually appears.

- **The `highway_detail/pdf/` drop folder is created by the app.** v0.21.0 looked for the TSN
  district prints there but never created the folder, so an updated install had nowhere to drop
  them. The TSN library now creates it on startup (and from Settings ▸ "Open TSN library folder"),
  with a hint file inside explaining what goes there — and the library's README refreshes on
  update instead of staying frozen at the version that first wrote it.
- **The evidence toggle wakes up when you come back.** After dropping the PDFs, re-entering the
  Everything matrix or the by-day matrix re-checks for them — no restart needed to un-grey the
  "Evidence images" option.

## v0.21.0 — 2026-07-08

**Evidence images** — the manual "screenshot both PDFs and circle the cell" workflow, automated.
When a Highway Detail vs-TSN comparison finds differences, the app can now render the proof for
you: for every differing column it samples random example rows (random routes, not just the first),
finds that exact cell in **both** source PDFs — the TSMIS "Highway Detail (PDF)" export and the TSN
district print — and produces captioned images with the cell boxed in red on each side.

- **Turn it on from either matrix page.** A shared "Evidence images" option (with a per-column
  example count, 1–10) lives under *Comparison output* on the Everything matrix and the Compare
  tab's by-day matrix. When it's on, each supported vs-TSN comparison also writes a
  **"… (evidence).xlsx"** — a summary plus every image embedded — and a **"… (evidence images)"**
  folder holding each example in two layouts: stacked (easy reading) and side-by-side (ready to
  paste into a report). Both writes keep the previous set if anything fails or a file is open.
- **What you need in place.** Drop the TSN Highway Detail **district PDFs** into the TSN library's
  `highway_detail/pdf/` folder (any filenames — the app reads each file's own district header),
  and have the day's **Highway Detail (PDF)** export alongside the Excel one. The option stays
  greyed with a hint until the PDFs are in place. Rebuild the TSN library once after updating
  (Settings ▸ TSN reports — the app will prompt; the library now records each row's district so
  evidence can find the right print).
- **Every example is verified before it's shown.** The cell is parsed back out of each PDF and
  normalized exactly like the comparison — an image can never show something other than what was
  compared, so the evidence set doubles as an end-to-end spot-check of the comparison itself.
  Candidates that fail (for example the known case where the PDF and Excel exports came from
  different site builds) are skipped, with the reason recorded in the workbook.
- Applies to both Highway Detail rows (Excel-based and PDF-based vs TSN). Other reports can join
  once they have PDF editions on both sides.
- The portable app now ships the PDF-rendering pieces this needs (about 20 MB larger); the
  build's self-test proves the render path works before anything is released.

## v0.20.0 — 2026-07-07

Highway Detail is now a fully integrated report: consolidate it, compare it against TSN, check its
two exports against each other, and see it in both matrices — the same treatment every other report
gets. The schema and every comparison rule were verified against a full statewide export set (252
routes / 51,243 rows), the statewide TSN "TSAR - HIGHWAY DETAIL" extract (60,083 rows), and all 12
TSN district PDFs.

- **Consolidate Highway Detail.** Two new consolidators, exactly like the Highway Log /
  Intersection Detail pairs: **Highway Detail** combines the per-route Excel exports (with a hover
  legend explaining every column), and **TSMIS Highway Detail (PDF)** parses the app's own PDF
  export into the identical 34-column format.
- **Compare Highway Detail against TSN.** A new TSMIS-vs-TSN comparison with the full discrepancy
  workbook — Summary / Spot Check / Comparison / Routes / Only-in tabs — plus a **Report View**
  sheet that replicates the printed two-line TASAS record with every difference in red (the
  Intersection Detail treatment), and a **Notes** sheet documenting every normalization applied.
  The TSN side lives in the TSN library (Settings ▸ TSN reports): import the statewide
  "TSAR - HIGHWAY DETAIL" Excel extract once and every comparison reuses it. (The TSN district
  PDFs were cross-checked against that extract — 57,647 records, every shared field ≥99.9%
  identical — so the machine-readable Excel is the library source.)
- **Rows pair correctly across the two systems' different conventions.** TSMIS tags an
  independent-alignment roadbed by gluing R/L onto the postmile ("000.080R") where TSN prints a
  bare postmile and says R/L in the Highway Group column — the comparison unifies the two, so
  routes like 282 and 880S match row-for-row instead of showing as all-missing. The equation
  marker "E", which the two systems attach to different rows, is compared as its own "PS" column
  instead of splitting rows apart. TSN's explicit "A" (add mileage) matches TSMIS's blank, its
  unpadded numbers match TSMIS's zero-padded ones ("2" = "02"), and its raw-precision lengths
  match the printed 3-decimal miles.
- **Check the PDF export against the Excel export.** "Highway Detail — TSMIS (PDF) vs TSMIS
  (Excel)" diffs the two renders of the same report so you can prove both exports carry the same
  data; "TSMIS (PDF) vs TSN" covers the PDF side against TSN. Both mirror the existing Highway
  Log / Intersection Detail checks.
- **In both matrices.** Highway Detail and Highway Detail (PDF) are rows in the Everything matrix
  (cross-environment) and the vs-TSN by-day matrix, with the same auto-consolidate and freshness
  behavior as every other report. Highway Summary remains export-only until its schema can be
  verified the same way.

## v0.19.3 — 2026-07-07

A field fix for the new Highway Detail export.

- **Highway Detail no longer re-selects the report on every route.** Because Highway Detail sits in
  the site's new grouped "Highway ▸ Detail" menu, the app's per-route safety check kept mistaking the
  short menu label ("Detail") for a changed selection and re-picking the report on every single route
  — flooding the log with "report form drifted" and slowing the run. The check now confirms the report
  by its stable id instead of the on-screen text, so it stays quiet on the happy path while still
  catching a genuinely reset form. Exports were always correct; this just removes the wasted work and
  the noise. (Applies to both the Excel and PDF editions of Highway Detail.)

## v0.19.2 — 2026-07-07

Two export improvements for the new Highway Detail report.

- **Highway Detail can now be exported as a PDF.** Alongside its Excel export (added in v0.19.1),
  Highway Detail now has a print-layout **PDF** edition — the same page-per-route Print output that
  Highway Log and Intersection Detail already offer. It appears next to the Excel version on the
  Export tab.
- **Selecting both editions of a report no longer runs it twice.** When you tick both the Excel and
  the PDF version of the same report (Highway Log, Intersection Detail, or Highway Detail), the app
  now loads each route **once** and saves both files from that single result — instead of generating
  the whole report a second time. Faster, and easier on the TSMIS server. (Fast mode still runs each
  edition on its own for now.)

## v0.19.1 — 2026-07-06

Two things: the Highway Detail / Highway Summary exports go live, and a validation glitch found
on the work PC is fixed. Comparison numbers are unchanged.

- **Highway Detail and Highway Summary can now be exported.** These two reports — previously listed
  as "coming soon" — are now on the Export tab and in Export Everything, exactly like the others.
  (Consolidating and comparing them against TSN comes in a later update.) Where the site still has
  them turned off, the app says so clearly and skips them instead of stalling.
- **"Validate & package results" no longer reports a phantom error.** On a PC that keeps TSN
  Highway Log files inside the export store, validation mistakenly treated that drop folder as an
  export environment and flagged a false error for it. Validation now only checks real export
  environments.

## v0.19.0 — 2026-07-06

Usability and trust improvements, plus the structural cleanup groundwork. No change to how any
comparison is calculated (the numbers are identical to v0.18.5 — re-blessed).

- **One-click validation.** A new **Settings ▸ "Validate & package results"** button runs every
  report already on this PC through the real comparison pipeline and saves everything a maintainer
  needs — outcomes, TSN freshness, logs, and a per-comparison summary — into one file. It confirms
  first (it refreshes those comparison cells and can take a few minutes), shows progress, and can
  be cancelled. This replaces the old command-line evidence step.
- **The same report organization everywhere.** The Consolidate and Compare tabs now group reports
  into the same Ramp / Intersection / Highway families as the Export tab, so a report sits in the
  same place on every tab.
- **Add today to the by-day matrix before exporting.** Today's column now appears in the vs-TSN
  by-day matrix even before you've exported anything for it — so you can export straight into it
  from the matrix instead of having to export elsewhere first.
- **Matrix panels stay usable while a comparison runs.** On smaller/laptop screens the two panels
  on the right no longer shrink to unusable sizes when a job is in progress.
- **Under the hood: the structural cleanup.** The whole codebase was reorganized for the next
  features without changing behavior: every comparator now rides one shared engine skeleton, the
  PDF parsers share one table library, the big GUI files split into focused modules, and adding a
  new report family (Highway Detail/Summary is reserved) is now a proven recipe with its own
  automated check. The comparison engine's numbers were re-verified cell-for-cell against the real
  statewide data (2.79M cells identical; the approved counts unchanged).
- **Safety hardening.** "Delete all reports" now only ever deletes folders this app itself created
  (a look-alike folder is flagged and left alone); an update re-verifies its download's integrity
  one final time right before installing; and the Export Everything destination is validated when
  you pick it (a network share or missing folder is refused with a clear message).

## v0.18.5 — 2026-07-03

The audit release: every confirmed finding from the full-repo audit, with no new features.
Highlights (the full map is `docs/planning/fable5-repo-improvement-audit.md`):

- **Comparisons self-heal after app updates.** The TSN library now records which
  normalization version built it; when an update improves the comparison rules, the affected
  report rebuilds itself from your raw TSN files the next time a comparison runs (previously a
  fix could silently "look unfixed" until a manual Settings ▸ Rebuild).
- **A real 0 never reads as blank.** The remaining places where a numeric zero (a postmile,
  a route token) could blank out — mis-aligning or falsely flagging rows — now keep it.
  Verified cell-for-cell identical on the real statewide data (canary unchanged).
- **Big comparisons skip the live-formulas twin again.** The v0.18.2 skip for 12k+-row
  comparisons had shipped inert; it now actually skips (and is locked by a test that runs it
  against a real workbook). The Intersection Detail "Report View" also builds faster.
- **Consolidating with a file open in Excel no longer reads incomplete.** Excel's `~$` lock
  stubs were being counted as unreadable inputs, demoting a healthy consolidation to partial.
- **Compare tab: Browse… no longer overrides your later folder picks.** A custom folder
  stays available in the dropdown but never silently wins over a run folder you selected after.
- **Starting a task during the background sign-in check now says so** ("try again in a few
  seconds") instead of failing with a browser error — and the check steps aside for you.
- **An interrupted update can no longer strand a mixed install.** If the swap is killed
  mid-rename (power loss), the next launch completes it or rolls it back — it used to delete
  the recovery pieces.
- **Quieter, more answerable logs.** The GUI, console and login flows write separate log
  files (simultaneous runs used to silently drop lines), every swallowed error now logs its
  reason, and the delete-all preview warns if part of the store couldn't be inspected.
- **Quality-of-life:** modals keep keyboard focus; route pickers and tabs are
  keyboard-operable; empty TSN imports error instead of producing an empty "complete"
  library; the release pipeline now refuses to publish if any check fails.

## v0.18.4 — 2026-06-29

A fix for the comparison matrices' job queue.

- **The queue no longer shows a finished job as still "running."** After a matrix or by-day
  (vs-TSN) comparison finished — or was cancelled — its row could stay in the queue panel
  marked "running" (in both the Everything and by-day matrices) until you started another job,
  and it couldn't be cleared. The work always actually finished; only the panel was stale. It
  now updates the moment a job ends.

## v0.18.3 — 2026-06-29

Two corrections to the Intersection Detail vs-TSN comparison, found in field use.

- **No more false "intersecting-route postmile" differences.** When a crossing route's postmile
  is 0 in both systems, the comparison was flagging it as a difference — TSN's numeric 0 was being
  read as blank while TSMIS showed "0.000". It now reads 0 on both sides and matches; a genuinely
  missing value still flags as before.
- **One-sided intersections are now labelled, not shown as all-red.** In the Intersection Detail
  "Report View", an intersection that exists in only one system is marked **"TSMIS only" / "TSN
  only"** (a coloured band) instead of appearing as an ordinary row with every field flagged red —
  matching how the main comparison sheet already shows them.

## v0.18.2 — 2026-06-29

A small follow-up to v0.18.1: it makes the largest comparison (Intersection Detail vs TSN)
feel responsive instead of frozen, speeds up bulk comparison rebuilds, and surfaces the
route's letter suffix in the Intersection Detail "Report View".

- **The big comparison no longer looks stuck.** Building the Intersection Detail vs-TSN
  workbook (by far the largest — about 17,000 rows) used to go quiet for a few minutes during
  its final "Report View" step, which looked like a freeze. It now shows steady progress the
  whole way through, so you can see it's still working — and **Stop takes effect sooner**.
- **Faster bulk comparison rebuilds.** When the matrix rebuilds comparisons, the optional
  live-formulas copy is now skipped for very large reports (it's millions of live formulas and
  several minutes of extra work). The normal workbook still contains **every value**, and the
  log notes when the copy was skipped. You can still build a live-formulas copy of a single
  comparison yourself from the Compare tab.
- **Route Suffix now shows in the Intersection Detail "Report View".** The route's letter
  suffix (e.g. the "U" in "210U") now sits next to the route in the printed-style Report View
  and turns red when TSMIS and TSN disagree — matching the "Route Suffix" column already on the
  Comparison tab.

## v0.18.1 — 2026-06-26

A field-validated follow-up to v0.18.0: it keeps exports working as the TSMIS site
changes its report menu, tidies the report list, and fixes two issues found in use.

- **Keeps working as the TSMIS site reorganizes its report menu.** The site is moving its
  report dropdown to grouped fly-out menus (Ramp / Highway / Intersection), already live on
  the development site. The exporter now picks each report by its stable id, so it works on
  both the current production menu and the new grouped one — your exports keep running
  through the changeover, with nothing for you to do.
- **The report list is grouped like the website.** Highway Log, Highway Log (PDF) and
  Highway Sequence stay at the top; the Ramp and Intersection reports are tucked under their
  own headings, matching how the TSMIS site now lists them.
- **Highway Detail and Highway Summary are listed as "coming soon."** The site is adding two
  new reports; you'll see them greyed under a "Highway" heading so you know they're on the
  way — they switch on here as soon as the site enables them.
- **The matrix queue clears properly.** After a matrix or by-day job finished, a leftover
  item could linger in the queue and couldn't be cleared or cancelled. The queue now always
  reflects what's actually running.
- **Clearer comparison heading.** In the Intersection Detail comparison, the column that
  flags a route's letter suffix (e.g. "210U" vs "210") is now labelled **"Route Suffix"**
  instead of "Roadbed" — the figures are unchanged, only the heading is clearer.

## v0.18.0 — 2026-06-26

A big under-the-hood overhaul for reliability and maintainability — plus one new
report. The day-to-day workflow is unchanged; what changed is how carefully the tool
treats your results when something goes wrong, and how the app is built and updated.

- **New report: Intersection Detail (PDF).** Alongside the Excel "Intersection Detail",
  you can now export it as a PDF — exactly the way Highway Log already offers both. It
  consolidates into one workbook and compares (between environments, vs TSN, and
  PDF-vs-Excel) like every other report, and it appears on both matrices.
- **A partial run never looks "finished" anymore.** If some routes or inputs fail or
  come back empty, the result is now clearly marked **incomplete** (amber on the matrix)
  instead of green — and an incomplete refresh is never cached or compared as if it were
  complete. You always know whether a column is the full picture.
- **A failed refresh never clobbers your last good copy.** Consolidated workbooks are now
  written transactionally (write-then-swap): if a refresh is interrupted or fails midway,
  the previous good file is kept intact rather than left half-written.
- **A safer self-updater.** An update now **refuses to install** unless its download
  matches a published checksum (no more "install it anyway"), re-checks the staged files
  one last time right before swapping them in, rejects any tampered archive, retries a
  flaky download, and can still roll back to an older version far down the release list.
- **Reset stays inside the app's own folders.** "Reset" / cleanup now refuses to follow a
  junction or symlink out of the app's data area, so it can only ever clear what it owns.
- **Under the hood.** The engine, the GUI bridge, and the report registry were
  reorganized into many small, single-purpose modules with a single report catalog as the
  source of truth; the full automated test suite now runs against the **exact** packaged
  executable, and the build is pinned to a verified dependency set so every release is
  reproducible. No change you need to do anything about — just a sturdier foundation.

## v0.17.1 — 2026-06-21

A quick fix-up of issues found using v0.17.0 on the matrices.

- **No more blank space below the matrices.** A hidden control in the Matrix-options
  panel was stretching the page so it could scroll down into a large empty area below
  the window. The panel's fast-mode / comparison-output toggles are now contained, so
  the matrix tabs stay put.
- **The Matrix-options panel is usable again.** On shorter screens it was being squeezed
  into a tiny scrolling sliver while the activity log hogged the space — now the options
  (queue, day columns, set-all modes, report toggles, fast mode) get the room and the log
  shrinks to a compact status strip.
- **Stop / Clear now work quickly when sign-in is failing or slow.** A matrix export that
  couldn't sign in used to ignore **Stop all** / **Clear queued** until its sign-in
  attempt timed out; both now interrupt the sign-in within about a second (normal and
  fast mode), so a stuck queue clears right away instead of feeling frozen.
- **The TSN "Choose…" picker opens to the TSN library.** Picking a TSN workbook on either
  matrix now starts in that report's own folder inside the TSN library, instead of the old
  per-run input location.
- **The TSN library is now self-documenting.** It starts as a ready-made folder tree —
  each report has its own `…/<report>/raw/` folder with a short note saying which file(s)
  to drop there, plus a README — so it's clear where to put your TSN reports before you
  import the first one. **Open folder** (Settings ▸ TSN reports) creates this tree on
  demand too.

## v0.17.0 — 2026-06-20

- **Every report now compares against TSN — not just Highway Log.** Ramp Summary,
  Ramp Detail, Highway Sequence, Highway Log (Excel and PDF), and Intersection
  Summary & Detail each have a TSMIS-vs-TSN comparison, live in **both** the Everything
  matrix and the by-day "vs TSN" matrix. The rows that used to be greyed "coming next
  update" are now active, and **"Set all to vs TSN"** switches every report at once.
- **And every report compares between environments.** Intersection Summary/Detail and
  Highway Log (PDF) gained their cross-environment comparison too, so the grid is now
  complete: every report × {between environments, vs TSN}, plus Highway Log's
  PDF-vs-Excel self-check.
- **Intersection Summary & Detail now consolidate** into a single workbook like every
  other report — so they can be compared and reused, not just exported.
- **A home for your TSN data.** Each report's TSN source (district PDFs or a statewide
  workbook) lives in one fixed folder, managed from a new **Settings ▸ TSN reports**
  panel: import the raw file(s) once, click **Rebuild**, and a status dot shows whether
  the comparison data is current. The panel shows the folder location with an
  **Open folder** button, and on the matrix each report has its own TSN picker.
- **One-stop "Export today" on the vs-TSN-by-day matrix.** A new **Export today →**
  button (and per-row / per-cell ↻) pulls a fresh, dated column for every report and
  automatically consolidates and compares each one against TSN — filling the column in
  one go. Only today is exportable; past days stay as the immutable record you pulled.
  Fast mode, worker count, and pause/skip all apply.
- **Sign-in and browser, made obvious.** Edge one-click sign-in is now checked quietly
  in the background (on launch and when you switch site), so the indicator lights up by
  itself. The **Log in** button now simply opens Google Chrome to save a reusable login.
  The old Browser dropdown is gone — the title bar shows a read-only **"Export via …"**
  indicator of what's actually exporting, and the one real choice (Built-in Chromium vs
  installed Chrome, Chrome by default) moved to **Settings ▸ Export browser**. Microsoft
  Edge is still used for one-click sign-in and as a fallback.
- **The matrices warn you before an export fails.** When the environment check has found
  a report greyed-out or missing on a site, both matrices now flag that report/cell amber
  — the same warning the Export tab shows — so a doomed comparison is obvious up front.
- **Drag to reorder.** Rows and columns on both matrices can be dragged into the order
  you prefer; the order is remembered.
- **Divided-roadbed routes match correctly.** Intersection rows whose TSN route carries a
  roadbed suffix (e.g. 210U vs 210) are now matched to their TSMIS counterpart, with a
  note when the suffix is the only difference.
- **Reliability + polish.** The Highway Log PDF reader now flags an incomplete parse
  instead of silently dropping rows; a thorough UI-consistency pass; and a large new set
  of automated checks across every new comparison.

## v0.16.1 — 2026-06-19

- **The TSN comparison view is now a full matrix that covers every report.** The
  Compare tab's sub-tabs are now **Cross-environment**, **vs TSN**, and **vs TSN
  Matrix**. The matrix (formerly "TSN by day") fills the screen like the Everything
  matrix and lists every report — Highway Log works today; Ramp Summary/Detail,
  Highway Sequence, and Intersection Summary/Detail appear greyed until their TSN
  comparison is added in the next update. (Highway Log's between-environments
  comparison moved back onto "Cross-environment" with the other reports.)
- **Pause, resume, and skip a matrix re-export — and watch it live.** A matrix
  re-export now shows the same per-route progress and live preview as the Export tab,
  and you can pause/resume or skip a stuck route without cancelling the whole run.
- **Pick the number of browsers for matrix Fast mode.** A browser-count picker sits
  next to the Fast mode toggle (shared with the Export tab and Settings, so it's one
  value).
- **Consolidated workbooks are saved and reused.** A comparison reuses the day's
  existing consolidated workbook instead of rebuilding it every time; a small
  indicator shows whether one exists and is current, with one click to refresh it.
- **Optional live-formulas copy of any comparison.** A toggle writes an auditable,
  recalculating workbook beside the plain values copy; each matrix remembers its own
  setting.
- **Export Intersection Summary & Detail.** These are greyed on the production TSMIS
  site but available on the development site — a new **Settings ▸ "Use development
  site"** switch points the app there (and back).
- **Fits short, wide laptop screens.** The comparison matrices no longer scroll after
  a couple of rows — the grid reclaims the surrounding space and shows all rows.
- **Polish.** The matrix-options checkboxes now match the rest of the app (no stray
  white boxes in dark mode), plus accessibility and reliability fixes across both
  matrices.

## v0.16.0 — 2026-06-19

- **Queue up matrix work instead of waiting.** On the Everything tab's
  Comparison matrix, a second action no longer says "a task is already running" —
  it joins a **queue** that runs one job at a time and moves on by itself. The
  queue is shown right on the matrix, and you can reorder it, remove a job, clear
  what's waiting, or stop everything. Line up a re-export and a rebuild, or several
  cells in a row, and walk away.
- **Two clear buttons on every row and column.** Each report row and each
  environment column now has **two** buttons with distinct icons: one **re-exports**
  that report/environment live from TSMIS, the other **rebuilds its comparisons** —
  so the bulk "refresh" you want is never ambiguous. (Re-exporting a whole row or
  column asks first, since it pulls many reports from TSMIS.)
- **Fast mode for matrix re-exports.** A new **Fast mode** toggle on the matrix
  runs re-exports with several browsers at once (the same speed-up the Export tab
  has), for when you're refreshing a lot at once.
- **New: compare exports day-by-day against TSN.** A new **"TSN by day"** sub-tab
  on the Compare tab lets you pick specific exported **days** and compare each one's
  Highway Log against TSN side by side — e.g. the 17th vs TSN next to the 18th vs
  TSN. Pick a data source, add the days you want as columns, and build each cell;
  it reuses the same TSN dataset and comparison engine as the Everything matrix.
  Highway Log (Excel and PDF) works now; the other reports appear greyed until their
  TSN comparison is added.

## v0.15.0 — 2026-06-19

- **New: a comparison matrix on the Everything tab.** A new **Comparison
  matrix** sub-tab shows every report against every data source / environment at
  a glance — each cell is colour-coded by how many differences it found (green
  for identical, shading from amber to red as differences grow), alongside the
  export date and a
  one-click link to open that comparison workbook. Choose the baseline to compare
  everything against; refresh a single cell, a whole row, a whole column, or every
  stale comparison at once; and cancel a long refresh and resume it later. Your
  matrix setup — the baseline, which reports and environments are shown, and the
  comparison mode per row — is remembered between sessions.
- **Compare the Highway Log against TSN, right in the matrix.** The Highway Log
  now appears as two rows — **Excel** and **PDF** — and each can compare
  cross-environment, against **TSN**, or Excel-vs-PDF. Drop the district TSN PDFs
  into the Everything folder and the matrix offers to consolidate them for you, or
  point a row at a consolidated TSN workbook; the file in use is shown right under
  the report name. (TSN comparisons for Ramp Summary, Ramp Detail and the Highway
  Sequence Listing appear greyed for now — groundwork for a later version.)
- **Choose what's on the matrix.** Toggle which report types and which
  environments appear, so the grid stays as compact or as complete as you need.
- **Intersection reports are clearly marked as not-yet-supported.** The two
  Intersection reports now show greyed-out everywhere (they're export-only, with no
  comparison), instead of quietly behaving differently from the rest.
- **A top-to-bottom visual polish.** Cleaner, more consistent buttons, dropdowns
  and file pickers across every tab — all readable in both light and dark mode —
  plus quick, non-intrusive animations throughout: panes, lists, the activity log
  and the light/dark switch now ease in smoothly (and fully respect the system's
  "reduce motion" setting).

## v0.14.3 — 2026-06-19

- **A "for IT" page now ships in the app folder.** Every download now
  includes an **`IT-README.txt`** next to `Start Here.txt` — a plain-language page
  for whoever in IT or security reviews the tool: what it connects to, what it
  reads and writes, how the saved login is handled, and why a portable,
  self-updating, unsigned in-house app is safe to run. It rides app updates, so
  the page stays current from this version on.

## v0.14.2 — 2026-06-18

- **Consolidate tab cleanup.** The three Highway Log consolidations now
  have clear, parallel names — **TSMIS Highway Log (Excel)**, **TSMIS Highway Log
  (PDF)**, **TSN Highway Log (PDF)** — so the plain "Highway Log" can't be confused
  for the others. The **TSMIS Highway Log (PDF)** consolidation now reads the app's
  own "Highway Log (PDF)" export straight from the output folder (with the Export-day
  picker, like the Excel one) instead of a redundant drop folder — you no longer copy
  the app's own exports into an input folder. The "Export day" picker is now hidden
  for the one report it doesn't apply to (TSN, whose district PDFs come from outside
  the app).
- **A few UI labels now match what actually happens.** The environment
  check no longer wrongly flags **Highway Log (PDF)** as unavailable on every site
  (it shares the "Highway Log" dropdown option, so it now follows that report's
  result); the Export Everything description says it writes to your chosen
  destination folder (not "dated run folders"); the auto-consolidate note lists every
  report that has no consolidator; and **Delete all reports** now also clears the
  Highway-Log-PDF outputs and the Export Everything store, so a "fresh start" really
  is one.

## v0.14.1 — 2026-06-18

- **Highway Log comparisons in one place.** The Compare tab now has a
  **Highway Log** sub-tab gathering every Highway Log comparison — TSMIS vs TSN, the
  two PDF-sourced comparisons, and across environments — beside a
  **Cross-environment** sub-tab for the plain report comparisons, instead of the old
  three-way split. (v0.14.0 briefly made this a separate top-level tab; v0.14.1
  moves it to a sub-tab inside Compare.)

## v0.14.0 — 2026-06-18

- **An accurate Highway Log, sourced from the PDF.** The site's Highway
  Log **Excel** export is buggy — it drops rows and whole roadbed-geometry
  columns, expands the report's "same as the other roadbed" `+` markers into
  numbers, and mis-attaches descriptions. A new consolidation parses the Highway
  Log **PDF** export instead (drop the per-route PDFs into
  `input\tsmis_highway_log_pdf`), producing the same 31-column workbook **without**
  those export errors — verified row-for-row against all 252 routes.
- **Highway Log columns are correctly labeled.** The vendor Excel export
  mislabeled most Highway Log columns (e.g. "N/A" is really **Non-Add Mileage**;
  the cryptic roadbed codes are surface type, shoulder widths, lane counts, …; it
  even reused "RB SH" for two different columns). Every Highway Log workbook now
  uses the **report's own legend** labels, with the old label kept in `[brackets]`,
  a hover tooltip on every column, and a **Legend** sheet explaining each one. This
  is a relabel only — the data and comparison results are unchanged.
- **Divided-highway rows now line up correctly.** On a divided highway
  each segment has two rows (one per roadbed). TSMIS marks the roadbed in the
  location (`R021.466R`/`…L`); the TSN log marks it a different way. The comparison
  used to treat these as *different* locations, so the same physical roadbed row
  showed up as **"only in TSMIS" + "only in TSN"** instead of being compared —
  hiding thousands of genuine differences. It now recognizes the roadbed on both
  sides and pairs them, surfacing those differences (audited against the source
  PDFs — every pairing is the correct roadbed, none crossed).
- **"Same as the other roadbed" markers are handled.** A roadbed column
  printed as `+`/`++` means "this roadbed's value is on the paired row" — a
  pointer, not a value. Comparisons now treat it as such (it is **never** counted
  as a difference, on either source), and a comparison cell that resolved a `+`
  shows what it points to in a hover note.

## v0.13.1 — 2026-06-17

- **Highway Log can now be exported as a PDF.** A new **Highway Log
  (PDF)** report exports each route's Highway Log as a print-formatted PDF — the
  same layout the site's Print button produces (cover page + every page) — into
  `output/…/highway_log_pdf/`, alongside the existing Excel export. Tick it on the
  Export tab like any other report.
- **Comparisons match repeated locations correctly.** When a TSMIS-vs-TSN
  or cross-environment comparison had two rows at the **same location** (e.g. two
  `001 R000.129` segments), it used to pair them in the order they appear —
  first-with-first, second-with-second — so a row that actually matched the other
  side's *second* listing was wrongly flagged as different. It now pairs repeated
  locations by **which rows are most alike** (the most fields matching), not by
  order. The row's identity is unchanged (same Route + location); only the pairing
  of repeats is smarter. This can only *remove* false differences, never add one —
  on a full Highway Log comparison it cleared ~3,600 phantom differing cells.

## v0.13.0 — 2026-06-17

- **A clearer window, and it tells you what's happening.** The right
  side of the window now follows the whole run: before you start, a **summary of
  exactly what will happen** (which reports, how many routes, where it saves);
  while it runs, progress that spells out **exactly what's running** — for a
  single export the report and route, and for **Export Everything** the
  environment it's on (e.g. "Environment 2 of 6 · SSOR / Test"), the report
  within it, the route, an **estimated time remaining**, and a row of
  per-environment markers showing which are done, which is running, and which are
  still queued (so it's finally easy to see where a big run is at); and when it
  finishes, a **completion summary** with one-click **Open folder** and **Retry
  failed routes** (just the ones that failed, not the whole run). The window also
  **flashes in the taskbar when a run finishes** so you can look away and come
  back — turn that off in Settings if you'd rather it didn't. The header was
  tidied up and the report/environment checkboxes are now fully keyboard-friendly.
- **Revert to the previous version.** Settings now has a **Revert to
  previous version** button: if an update ever causes trouble, one click
  reinstalls the release just before this one, through the exact same verified
  download-and-swap the normal update uses (your reports, login and settings stay
  put). It only appears on installs the app can update itself.
- **Two separate "check environments automatically" switches.** The old
  single setting is now two: **after sign-in** (on by default) and **after the
  app starts** (off by default) — so the background environment check can run when
  you sign in without also running every single launch.
- **Compare tab is split into sub-tabs.** The two comparison kinds —
  **Cross-environment** and **TSMIS vs TSN** — are now on their own sub-tabs
  (cross-environment shown first), instead of sharing one long list.
- **Export Everything labels every file by environment.** Files in the
  always-current store are now named with their source/environment up front
  (e.g. `ssor-prod tsar_ramp_detail_route_5.xlsx`, and the combined workbook the
  same way), so a file copied out of the folder still says which environment it
  came from. The Everything tab also **colour-codes** report types and
  environments the last environment check flagged — amber for "may be limited",
  red for "would fail" — and now greys out during an environment check like the
  other tabs.

## v0.12.0 — 2026-06-17

- **Export Everything — one always-current set of reports.** A new
  **Everything** tab exports the report types you tick across the environments you
  tick into a single folder you choose (default **All Reports (current)**). Re-run
  it any time to refresh: it overwrites that folder in place, so it always holds
  the latest of every report. A **Saved reports** list shows how old each report
  is and flags any that are lagging behind the rest, with a one-click **Refresh**
  for just that report — plus pause/resume and resume-after-restart for the long
  full runs.
- **Pause / Resume a running export.** A new **Pause** button holds the
  run between routes and **Resume** picks it back up — separate from Skip (one
  route) and Cancel (stop the run). Works in fast mode too.
- **Auto-consolidate when an export finishes.** An optional checkbox
  builds the combined workbook automatically right after the export, so the
  Consolidate step happens for you.
- **Self-describing filenames.** Consolidated and comparison files now
  carry the date + source/environment in the filename, so a file copied out of
  its folder still says exactly which run it came from.
- **Compare tab lists only relevant folders.** The cross-environment
  folder pickers now show only export runs that actually contain the report type
  you picked, instead of every run folder.
- **Buttons never cut off.** The Start / Pause / Cancel bar stays pinned
  and visible while the report list scrolls, and the tab row no longer crowds.

## v0.11.1 — 2026-06-16

- **Flawless TSN Highway Log conversion.** The TSN district-PDF → Excel
  converter now transcribes feature descriptions perfectly across all 12
  districts — totals-block footer text and page furniture can no longer leak into
  a segment's Description. This removes ~1,000 false-positive "differences" from
  the TSMIS-vs-TSN Highway Log comparison (what remains is all genuine data
  differences). Real descriptions that merely contain words like "UNCONST" or
  "TOTAL" are now kept correctly.
- **Ramp Summary audit cell explains itself.** When a route's parsed
  section sub-totals don't add up to its stated total, the consolidated workbook's
  Audit cell now names the section that's short (e.g. "⚠ Source ≠ total: Ramp
  Types") instead of a bare red result — making clear it's a quirk in the source
  PDF's own numbers on a few dense routes, not a tool error.

## v0.11.0 — 2026-06-16

- **Comparisons are far more accurate.** Comparing the same report
  across two environments used to flag large numbers of "differences" that were
  really just rows shifting position — one missing point near the top made
  everything below it look changed. Comparisons now line rows up by their
  **postmile** (a row's real identity) instead of the coarser county, so a
  Highway Sequence comparison that used to show ~15,800 differing cells now
  shows ~5,000 genuine ones; only real differences remain.
- **A comparison never claims "everything matches" when it couldn't read a
  file.** If an input file is unreadable it's no longer silently
  skipped: the result says **"Comparison incomplete"** and the workbook lists
  exactly what was left out — instead of a misleading green "everything
  matches" that quietly ignored the missing data.
- **Cleaner TSN Highway Log conversion.** Totals-block text (running
  mileage, "CUMULATIVE", "TOTAL CONST UNCONST", …) no longer leaks into the
  Description column — which also removes the false differences it was causing
  in the TSMIS-vs-TSN comparison.
- **Empty routes no longer stall the export.** When a route has
  nothing to download, the tool now moves on within about a minute instead of
  waiting out the full multi-minute time limit, so a long run with many empty
  routes finishes much sooner. Empty Intersection reports are recognized
  correctly too.
- **Damaged or locked output files are handled.** A half-written or
  unreadable file left by an interrupted run is re-downloaded rather than
  trusted as "already done", and a file you happen to have open in Excel during
  a resume no longer breaks the run.
- **A failed report can't overwrite a good one.** If a Ramp Summary
  PDF fails to parse (or is a stub one-page file), the tool keeps the good
  workbook you already had instead of replacing it with a blank one.
- **Safer updates.** Before installing, the in-app update now verifies
  the downloaded file with a checksum and installs only the expected files —
  extra protection against a corrupted or tampered download. Sign-in tokens are
  also scrubbed from the saved session and the logs.
- **Spreadsheet safety.** Free-text fields that begin with `=`, `+`,
  `-` or `@` are stored as plain text so they can't run as spreadsheet formulas,
  and comparisons guard against Excel's row/column limits and duplicate sheet
  names instead of failing partway through.

## v0.10.4 — 2026-06-12

- **Intersection reports fixed.** The two new report types now match
  the site exactly: the menu entries are **Intersection Summary** and
  **Intersection Detail** (the site doesn't use a "TSAR:" prefix for them),
  and Summary exports as an **Excel** file like Detail. The environment check
  no longer reports them missing.
- **See both sign-in paths at a glance.** The title bar now shows
  two small indicators: **Saved login** (the session file captured via
  Chrome / Built-in Chromium — what exports use, required for fast mode;
  age in the tooltip) and **Edge one-click** (green once the hands-free
  Windows sign-in has worked this session, amber when it's set up but not
  yet used, grey when never set up).
- **The Dev / testing update channel was removed.** Updates come
  only from full releases on this page. The Update channel switch is gone
  from Settings; nothing else changes.

## v0.10.3 — 2026-06-12

- **Updates install reliably now.** The 0.10.2 update could fail
  halfway on some PCs and leave a confusing half-installed app ("says 0.10.2
  but features are missing") or quietly fall back to the old version. The
  install now prepares the whole new version next to the old one first and
  swaps it in with instant renames — it either fully installs or fully
  doesn't, a failed attempt says so the next time the update is offered, and
  the interface shown is always the one actually installed (no more stale
  screens after an update). The first launch after an update is also more
  patient: instead of a scary error while Windows checks the new files, it
  shows "Still starting…" and finishes by itself.
- **The environment check runs by itself.** After the app starts (or
  you sign in), it quietly verifies sign-in + report access on all six sites
  in the background — several at once when Google Chrome / the Built-in
  Chromium and a saved login are available, one at a time otherwise — and
  the title-bar chip + Settings rows fill in. Turn it off in Settings. The
  Export tab also flags any report type the current site has greyed out.
- **Two new reports: TSAR Intersection Summary & Detail.** Exported
  like the ramp pair (Summary → PDF, Detail → Excel) into their own folders.
  Consolidation/comparison for them comes later.
- **Fast mode no longer trips over managed Edge.** Parallel browsers
  (fast mode and the environment check) now run in the Built-in Chromium /
  Google Chrome; Microsoft Edge keeps the one-click sign-in and is only used
  for parallel work when nothing else is available.

## v0.10.2 — 2026-06-12

- **The new TSMIS address is built in.** The report site moved to
  `tsmis.dot.ca.gov`; this version points there out of the box for all six
  source/environment combinations. If you had entered the new address in
  Settings as a stopgap, that custom entry keeps working — clear the box to
  fall back to the (now identical) built-in default.
- **Check sign-in + report access for every environment.**
  Settings ▸ **Check all environments** opens each of the six sites
  (SSOR/ARS × Prod/Test/Dev) in the background exactly like an export and
  verifies that sign-in completes, the right site loaded, the report form
  can actually pull data, and **all four report types are offered** (the
  site sometimes greys one out). Verdicts land next to each address as they
  finish — green OK, amber "Reports limited" naming the unavailable report
  types, red for sign-in/data/site failures, full detail in the tooltip —
  and a title-bar chip ("Envs 5/6") shows the overall picture; click it to
  jump to the rows. Built for the "signs in fine but can't pull reports"
  situation, so a broken environment is a 2-minute check instead of a
  wasted export run.
- **Screenshots show their address.** The per-browser Preview and
  the Verify-environment screenshot now display the page's web address above
  the image, so which site/environment the browser is really on is readable
  in plain text (sign-in tokens never appear).
- **A Dev / testing update channel.** Settings ▸ Update channel —
  leave it on **Stable releases** (the default; nothing changes for you).
  Pick **Dev / testing builds** only when asked to try a fix: the title-bar
  update button then offers quick prerelease test builds, clearly labeled
  everywhere, and the next stable release returns the install to normal
  automatically.

## v0.10.1 — 2026-06-12

- **The one-click update now works on locked-down PCs.** On machines
  where PowerShell is blocked for standard users (common on managed work
  PCs), the previous updater downloaded the new version and then silently
  failed to install it — the app closed and the download just sat in
  `data\update`. The install step no longer uses PowerShell, cmd, scripts or
  admin rights at all: the downloaded new version installs itself. It also
  fails LOUDLY now — if the install step can't even start, the app stays
  open on the old version and says so instead of closing into nothing.
  **If an update left you stranded before:** install this version manually
  once (download the zip, replace the app's `TSMIS Exporter.exe`,
  `_internal` and `Start Here.txt` — your `data\` and `output\` stay put);
  from then on the green Update button does the whole job.

## v0.10.0 — 2026-06-12

- **Comparisons answer the real question first.** Every comparison
  now leads with a verdict — **“✓ EVERYTHING MATCHES”** in green when the two
  sides are identical (the expected outcome between environments), or
  **“✗ DIFFERENCES FOUND — N differing cells, M one-sided rows”**. It shows
  three ways: a dialog the moment the comparison finishes, the first line of
  the run log, and a big colored banner at the top of the workbook's Summary
  (live formula in the formulas flavor, so it stays current after edits and F9).
- **Change a TSMIS address without waiting for an update.** Settings
  lists the page address for all six source/environment combinations; edit
  one if a site moves and it's used by the very next sign-in, export or
  Verify. Custom addresses are marked; clearing the box restores the
  built-in default.
- **Download the Built-in Chromium from Settings.** The standard
  (smaller) app can now fetch the same unmanaged browser the “with-browser”
  download ships (~170 MB, into the app's data folder — it survives updates)
  and remove it again later. Handy when managed-Edge sign-in misbehaves and
  installing Chrome isn't an option; restart the app after and “Built-in
  Chromium” appears in the Browser dropdown.
- **Compare environments against each other.** The Compare tab now
  also compares the SAME report exported from two different places — SSOR vs
  ARS, prod vs dev/test, or today vs an older run. Pick the report type and
  two export folders (e.g. `2026-06-11 ssor-prod` vs `2026-06-11 ars-prod`);
  the per-route files are read straight from both — **no consolidation step
  needed** — and you get the same trusted discrepancy workbook as the
  TSMIS-vs-TSN comparison, with the environment names as the two sides.
  Works for all four reports: Ramp Detail, Highway Sequence and Highway Log
  compare their Excel exports; **Ramp Summary compares its PDFs** (parsed
  with the same engine the consolidator uses), one row per route. Routes
  missing from one environment are flagged "entire route", and the live
  SELF-CHECK rows prove the numbers in Excel itself.
- **Exports are labeled by environment.** Runs now land in
  `output\<date> <source>-<environment>\` (e.g. `2026-06-11 ssor-prod`), so
  exports from different sites never mix or overwrite — that's what makes
  the environment comparison possible. Older bare-date folders are read as
  ssor-prod everywhere (consolidation included); run-report CSVs carry the
  same tag.
- **See what every browser is doing.** During an export, the
  progress card shows one live status row per browser (current route, phase,
  elapsed) — fast mode shows all of them. Each row has a **Preview** button
  that pops an actual screenshot of that browser's page, so you can see the
  sign-in state, the report being built, and the site's own **SSOR / ARS +
  environment label** with your own eyes.
- **Verify the environment without exporting.** A **Verify** button
  next to the environment dropdowns opens TSMIS in the background exactly
  like an export would (signed in), reads which data source / environment
  the page ACTUALLY loaded, and shows a screenshot with a clear
  matches-your-selection verdict — catch a wrong-environment setup before
  spending hours exporting.
- **A Settings tab.** Reliability knobs (per-route time limits,
  county wait, default fast-mode browser count — raise them when the server
  is slow), debugging tools (verbose logging, DevTools, a one-click
  **support bundle** zip with logs + run reports and **never your login**),
  quick folder shortcuts, forget-saved-login, and **Delete all reports** —
  one button clears every generated file for a fresh start after showing
  exactly what will be removed; logs, login and settings always survive.

## v0.9.0 — 2026-06-12

- **Comparison: a fast values copy.** The Compare tab now offers two
  outputs — tick one or both. The **values workbook** holds plain computed
  results: it opens instantly with everything already filled in (no F9, no
  manual-calculation mode, about a third the size) and keeps all the
  navigation links, colors, the Spot Check sheet and the live self-checks.
  The **live-formulas workbook** stays the fully auditable version where
  every cell recalculates. With both ticked, the values copy is saved next
  to the other as "… (values).xlsx". Both are built from the same comparison
  pass, so they can never disagree.
- **Comparison: missing routes front and center + self-checks.** The
  TSMIS-vs-TSN workbook gains two new sheets — **Only in TSMIS** and **Only
  in TSN** — collecting every one-sided row in one place instead of leaving
  them scattered through the 50k-row Comparison sheet. Routes one system
  lacks entirely are flagged **"entire route"** and tinted, so missing-route
  coverage is impossible to overlook (filter the "Missing from …" column to
  separate whole-route gaps from single locations). The Summary also gains a
  **SELF-CHECK section**: each headline number is recomputed a second,
  independent way and shows OK/CHECK after you press F9 — proof that every
  formula still points at the right rows.
- **Comparison: built for skeptics.** Don't trust a red cell? The
  row numbers in the TSMIS Row / TSN Row columns are now **clickable** —
  they jump to the data sheet and **select the whole source row** so it
  stands out until you click elsewhere, and every data-sheet row links back
  to its Comparison row the same way. A new **Spot Check** sheet audits any
  single location end to end: type a row number (or find one by route +
  location) and every field shows the raw stored values from both systems
  next to an **independently recomputed verdict** — calculated straight from
  the data sheets, never reading the Comparison's answer — with an Agree?
  column that flags any disagreement. One-sided rows announce themselves on
  every field line (not just the status cell), difference cells are labeled
  **TSMIS first, TSN second**, and consolidated workbooks show a bold
  press-F9 reminder.
- **The app updates itself.** When a new version is published here, a
  green **Update to vX.Y.Z** button appears in the app's title bar: one click
  downloads it (picking the right variant automatically), then **Restart to
  update** swaps it in and reopens the app — reports, login and settings stay
  exactly where they are, and a failed swap rolls back to the old version.
  The version chip next to the app name re-checks on demand. PCs where the
  app folder is read-only get a button that opens this download page instead.
  (In-app updates also skip the zip "Unblock" problem entirely.)

## v0.8.2 — 2026-06-11

- **Comparison: single-side rows now show their data.** Rows that
  exist only in TSMIS (yellow) or only in TSN (blue) used to have blank
  field cells; they now display that system's own values, so what's missing
  from the other system is readable at a glance.

## v0.8.1 — 2026-06-11

- **Fix: the downloaded app now starts without unblocking the zip.**
  Extracting the release zip without right-click → Unblock tags every file
  as "from the internet", and Windows then refuses to load parts of the new
  interface — v0.8.0 died on launch with "Failed to resolve
  Python.Runtime…". The app now removes that flag from its own files at
  startup, so a plain download-extract-run works. (Unblocking the zip first
  is still good practice for SmartScreen.)

## v0.8.0 — 2026-06-11

- **TSN Highway Log + comparison.** The Consolidate tab gains **TSN
  Highway Log**: drop TSN district PDFs into `input\tsn_highway_log` and it
  converts them into TSMIS-format per-route Excel files plus one combined
  workbook. A new **Compare tab** then builds a TSMIS-vs-TSN discrepancy
  workbook from two per-route Highway Logs **or two consolidated ones (all
  routes)** — matching values shown plainly, differences highlighted in red,
  with live Excel formulas throughout (edit a value and the report
  recalculates). Consolidated comparisons add a **Routes sheet** (which
  routes each system covers, what's missing where, per-route diff counts)
  and open in **manual calculation** so the big workbook appears instantly —
  press **F9** once to calculate, then save.
- **A brand-new interface.** The window was rebuilt from scratch:
  a cleaner two-column layout (settings on the left, live progress + activity
  log on the right), per-route progress with running counts, clearer sign-in
  status, a searchable route picker, and a **System / Light / Dark theme
  toggle**. Most importantly it now **fits any screen** — on small or
  low-resolution displays the layout stacks and scrolls instead of cutting
  off the bottom buttons. (Under the hood the UI is rendered by Edge
  WebView2, which is part of Windows 10/11 — nothing extra to install; all
  export logic is unchanged.)
- **Chrome sign-in no longer nags about local network access.**
  Saving a login with Google Chrome used to require clicking "Allow" on the
  "access devices on your local network?" prompt every single time — and
  missing it meant the session silently didn't save. The sign-in windows now
  pre-grant that permission, same as the exports always have.

## v0.7.6 — 2026-06-11

- **The log now tells the whole story.** Every run writes a detailed
  trail to `data\logs\tsmis.log`: which build/PC produced it, every sign-in
  step, which browser was picked and why a fallback happened, what was clicked
  in the app, each route's outcome with timing and file size, and a full
  traceback for any crash (even ones the window can't show). Errors name the
  specific step that failed — so one log upload answers what used to take a
  back-and-forth.

## v0.7.5 — 2026-06-11

- **Sign-in works on the new TSMIS site.** Field diagnostics finally
  showed the sign-in was SUCCEEDING — and the tool's own post-sign-in
  "right data source?" check was then reloading the page, which destroys the
  app's memory-only session and strands the browser at the portal sign-in
  page. That check misread the app's config (it's not a `window` property)
  so it reloaded every time. Fixed: the config is read correctly, a reload
  happens only on a real env/src mismatch and is followed by a fresh sign-in
  pass, the IdP hop is driven directly via the portal's own SAML URL, and the
  log breadcrumbs every step of each sign-in attempt.
- **Pick the data source and environment.** Two new header dropdowns choose
  **SSOR or ARS** and **Prod / Test / Dev** (defaults: SSOR + Prod) — the tool
  now drives the new TSMIS site, one page for every combination. Console flow:
  set `TSMIS_SRC` / `TSMIS_ENV`.
- **Each day's exports get their own folder.** Files now land in
  `output\<YYYY-MM-DD>\<report>\`, so tomorrow's run starts fresh instead of
  skipping over today's files. The Consolidate tab gained an **Export day**
  picker (newest first, newest by default; console prompts, Enter = newest),
  and the combined workbook is saved in that day's `consolidated\` folder.
  Exports made with older versions are still found when no dated folders exist.
- **Fast mode is greyed out without a saved login**, with an explanation:
  automatic Edge sign-in runs one browser at a time (the sign-in profile can't
  be shared), so parallel runs need a saved session (e.g. sign in with Chrome).
- **Hands-free sign-in on managed Caltrans PCs** (since v0.6): after one normal
  Edge sign-in, login and exports sign themselves in automatically — no
  password, no window. Chrome stays on the manual sign-in path.
- First run: if Windows warns about an unknown publisher, choose
  "More info" → "Run anyway" (in-house unsigned tool). If downloaded as a zip,
  right-click → Properties → Unblock before extracting.

## v0.7.4 — 2026-06-11

- **Sign-in works on the new TSMIS site.** The portal showed its "Caltrans Azure
  AD" button before the button's click handler was wired up, so the tool's early
  click landed dead. It now keeps clicking each second until the page actually
  moves, and after several dead clicks drives the sign-in hop directly via the
  portal's own SAML URL. The Edge sign-in window also pre-grants the
  local-network permission.
- **Fits small screens.** The window caps its height to the screen and can be
  shrunk — the log pane absorbs the difference instead of the bottom buttons
  being cut off.

## v0.7.3 — 2026-06-11

- **Sign-in detection hardened, plus diagnostics.** Stronger signed-in detection
  (several post-sign-in signals, robust visibility checks) and deep sign-in
  diagnostics: the log records the app version and every sign-in attempt's
  outcome, and a failed sign-in saves a screenshot + page snapshot under
  `data\failures\` so problems can be pinpointed from one run.

## v0.7.2 — 2026-06-11

- **Sign-in works on the new TSMIS site.** The new app never shows a signed-out
  page — it redirects through the portal OAuth flow on every load and keeps its
  token in page memory only. The tool now rides that flow: it polls for the app's
  real post-sign-in state and clicks "Caltrans Azure AD" the moment the portal
  renders it, so saved Chrome sessions and the hands-free Edge sign-in work again
  (0.7.0/0.7.1 raced the redirect or watched for the wrong signals).

## v0.7.1 — 2026-06-11

- **Sign-in fix for the new report page.** The new page shows its own "Sign In
  with ArcGIS" button instead of redirecting, and renders the report form even
  when signed out — both broke automatic sign-in (Edge and Chrome) in 0.7.0. The
  tool now clicks the full chain (app button → portal page → "Caltrans Azure AD",
  popup-tolerant) and detects sign-in from the app's own state.

## v0.7.0 — 2026-06-11

- **Pick the data source and environment.** Two new header dropdowns choose
  **SSOR or ARS** and **Prod / Test / Dev** (defaults: SSOR + Prod) — the tool
  now drives the new TSMIS site, one page for every combination. Console flow:
  set `TSMIS_SRC` / `TSMIS_ENV`.

## v0.6.1 — 2026-06-10

- **Hands-free sign-in, refined.** After one normal Edge sign-in (which primes
  the app's own Edge profile), the tool signs in automatically — no password, no
  window — and exports can even start with **no saved login at all**: the export
  reopens that Edge profile, clicks "Caltrans Azure AD" itself, and Windows signs
  it in. Edge only (Chrome stays on the manual path); automatic sign-in runs one
  browser at a time, so save a login to use fast mode.

## v0.6.0 — 2026-06-10

- **Hands-free sign-in on managed Caltrans PCs.** The tool signs in
  **automatically** with Microsoft Edge and your Windows account — no password,
  no browser window. Each headless browser clicks "Caltrans Azure AD" itself and
  Windows signs it in (Edge only — Chrome stays on the manual sign-in path). The
  local-network permission the TSMIS site needs is pre-granted in every automated
  browser.

## v0.5.1 — 2026-06-10

- **Managed-Edge sign-in hardened.** Recovers the session even when org-managed
  Edge relaunches itself into the work profile mid-SSO (live capture, then CDP
  re-attach, then on-disk profile recapture), with a Google Chrome fallback if
  nothing was captured.

## v0.5.0 — 2026-06-10

- **Managed-Edge sign-in fixed.** Sign-in opens Edge with a durable app-owned
  profile and recovers the session even when org-managed Edge relaunches into the
  work profile mid-SSO, with a Google Chrome fallback if nothing was captured.

## v0.4.1 — 2026-06-05

- **Edge/Chrome login fixed.** Signing in no longer cancels itself the moment
  your password/MFA goes through — the session saves reliably.
- **A broken route fails fast.** If TSMIS itself errors on a route, it's recorded
  as Failed in seconds with the site's message instead of hanging for minutes.
- **Friendlier to IT / Defender.** Proper version details, an icon, and a
  no-admin manifest; the download is stripped of third-party documentation that
  could trip data-loss-prevention scanners.

## v0.4.0 — 2026-06-05

- **New report: Highway Log.** Bulk-export the Highway Log for every route
  (XLSX), plus a matching consolidator to combine them.
- **Export several report types at once.** Tick any combination (or all) and they
  run back-to-back in one go.
- **Cancel actually cancels now.** It stops the report it's currently working on
  right away instead of waiting for that route to finish first.
- **Fast mode is sturdier.** If one browser hits a snag the others keep going,
  and any routes that get dropped are retried rather than silently skipped.

## v0.3.0 — 2026-06-05

- **Much smaller — ~587 MB → ~148 MB.** No longer bundles Chromium; it uses the
  **Microsoft Edge (or Chrome) already installed** on the machine. This also
  fixes the SharePoint/DLP "blocked file" problem from the old bundled doc files.
- **Browser picker + startup checks in the header.** Choose Edge or Chrome, with
  readiness dots for the browser, output folder, and report tools.
- **Choose which routes to export.** Leave the Routes box blank for all, or type
  a few (e.g. `5, 99, 101`).
- **Automatic retry.** Routes that fail get one more patient, one-at-a-time
  attempt at the end of the run.
- **Login fixes.** Confirms you actually signed in before saving, and closing the
  sign-in window no longer leaves the app stuck on "Waiting…".

## v0.2.0 — 2026-06-04

- **Experimental fast mode.** Run several headless browsers at once to export
  routes in parallel (default 3, up to 30; each uses ~0.5 GB RAM).
- **Live elapsed timer** beneath the progress bar during a run.
- **Clearer run summary.** Adds an "already had" count for routes saved on a
  previous run, so the numbers reconcile to the full route count.

## v0.1.0-preview — 2026-06-04

- **Initial preview build.** First portable Windows release — no install, no
  Python required. Sign in with your Caltrans `@dot.ca.gov` account + MFA, export
  a report for every route, consolidate the per-route files into one workbook, and
  save a per-route outcome CSV. Bundles its own Chromium. Preview build, pending
  live verification against TSMIS.
