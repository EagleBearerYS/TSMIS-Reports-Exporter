# Reproducible portable build for TSMIS Reports Exporter.
#
# Produces a self-contained onefolder under dist\<AppName>\ that bundles Python
# and every dependency -- no installer and no Python required on the target
# machine. No browser is bundled: the app drives the machine's installed Edge /
# Chrome (only Playwright's Node driver ships). Zip that folder to distribute.
#
# Usage (from the repo root):
#   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File build\build.ps1
#
# Proven on Windows + Python 3.11 in the Phase 1 spike. See build\app.spec for
# the packaging recipe.

# at that folder, and common.py then lists "Built-in Chromium" as the default

# headless shell: channel="chromium" runs the full browser in new-headless
# mode, so one binary serves headed sign-in AND headless exports. Done BEFORE
# the prune so its locale trimming applies to the browser too.

# number remains, so a release can never reintroduce the problem.
