"""Golden check for the ArcGIS tab's "ArcGIS reports" library + "Reports vs
ArcGIS" matrix (scripts/arcgis_matrix.py; 2026-09-02, editions + the reports tab
v0.47.0): the registry-derived EDITION rows (Excel and PDF each a row, both
compared against their report's ONE ArcGIS build), the layer DROP identity, the
library's per-report build state (built / trusted / from the staged drop / the
last refresh that did not land), the snapshot's cell states (needs ArcGIS build /
needs export / buildable / stale), the scoped rebuild list, build_cell's
orchestration + cache recording via the SHARED primitives (stubbed so no real
report data is needed) for both editions, build_report's guards + as-of default,
the ArcGIS reports endpoints + the multi-report refresh worker, and the boundary
validation.

openpyxl only — no browser/network. Run with the build venv:
