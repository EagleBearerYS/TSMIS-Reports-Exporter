"""Golden check for the TSMIS-vs-TSN Intersection Summary comparator
(scripts/compare_intersection_summary_tsn.py) — the AGGREGATE recipe applied to
the intersection taxonomy.

Locks: the canonical spec (66 categories after the signal fold; unique keys/slugs),
the CONTROL-TYPE signal crosswalk (TSN sub-types J–P fold into the shared 'S -
SIGNALIZED' category, matching the Detail — so Signalized compares on BOTH sides and
there are NO TSN-only codes left), the remaining genuinely one-sided TSMIS-only codes
(Roundabout R / PHB O / Flash Q / intersection R/C/P / left-chan Y — absent from the
TSN summary PDF), the '+ no data' buckets the TSN PDF reports as 0 being compared
(num-of-lanes '+' is now BOTH), the spec-driven block-walk mapper (incl. the J–P→S
fold and the Rural/Urban '-O OUTSIDE CITY' parent disambiguation — a count-less
parent still binds its child and a counted orphan '-O' refuses, CMP-AUD-023), the
strict consolidated-workbook summing loader (CMP-AUD-021/022: numeric text parses,
fractions/booleans/duplicates refuse, absent columns stay absent), the independent
per-side partition validation with exposed bounded residuals (CMP-AUD-020), and
end-to-end structure. No Excel; CI-safe.
