# TSMIS Reports Exporter — knowledge library

The canonical, deduplicated home for everything we know about this project, written
for contributors and coding agents working on the repo. Each file is the **single source of
truth** for its domain; where topics overlap, the owner holds the detail and the
others link to it.

**Start here:** [`project-guide.md`](project-guide.md) is the shared **working guide** — it carries the
project snapshot and the non-negotiable conventions, and points into this library.
Read the conventions there first, then come here for the deep dive on whatever you're
touching.

## Current status and work

**Current release: v0.50.0 (2026-10-23)** — the three Clean Road files compare
against the ArcGIS layers on the Reports vs ArcGIS matrix, and a Clean Road row with
no postmile no longer stops a comparison; every export run folder records which
TSMIS site it came from (`… ssor-prod dev-site` / `main-site`), and each day matrix
picks which site's exports it compares; since v0.48.0 every edition of every report
consolidates and compares (22 rows). The comparison-audit ledger records 246
closed findings. Confirm release state in `version.py` and `CHANGELOG.md`;
the roadmap tracks remaining acceptance, follow-ups, and feature work.

- **Start every session at [roadmap.md](roadmap.md)** — its `▣ OPEN WORK INVENTORY`
  is the definitive list of what is left, and the banner above it says where things
  stand and what is next. Re-verify a line against the code before acting on it.
- **Completed output-audit program:**
  [planning/post-comparison-perfection-output-audit/START-HERE.md](planning/post-comparison-perfection-output-audit/START-HERE.md)
  records the completed program. All six RB bundles are merged; RB-5 shipped in
  v0.42.0 and RB-6 in v0.44.0. Its dated approvals and role assignments are history,
  not a live queue. Remaining follow-ups are in the roadmap.
- **Planning and handoff records:** [planning/README.md](planning/README.md)
  distinguishes reusable references from historical plans. Model names in old
  filenames, evidence paths, and sign-offs preserve provenance; they do not
  restrict who may perform a role today. The closed mission in
  [agent-handoffs/STATUS.md](agent-handoffs/STATUS.md) is also historical.

## The docs

| Doc | Read this when… |
|---|---|
| [project-guide.md](project-guide.md) | Shared project context and working conventions for every contributor; both root instruction files redirect here. |
| [architecture.md](architecture.md) | You need the big picture — the console-free core + two front-ends, the `Events` seam, the single report registry, run folders, the data-location model, **"The app today"** (the six tabs and the three source lanes, current at v0.41.0), and the v0.12→v0.18 feature buckets as a historical record. |
| [engine-and-reliability.md](engine-and-reliability.md) | You're touching the export loop's runtime behavior — resume + integrity gate, skip/cancel, retry, the fast-fails (`EmptyExport`/`ReportError`/`ReportUnavailableError`), timeouts, fast mode, preflight, run reports. |
| [auth-and-signin.md](auth-and-signin.md) | Anything about signing into TSMIS — the token-in-hash session model, the `CONFIG` lexical-global trap, device sign-in / Edge recapture / portability, LNA pre-grant, signed-in detection, the two login chips. |
| [gui.md](gui.md) | You're in the desktop GUI — pywebview/WebView2, the threading + queue model, Python↔JS layering, the **five pywebview traps**, the `#mock` preview and its gotchas. |
| [reports.md](reports.md) | You need the report catalog, a single report's `ReportSpec`/save/empty behavior, the `cs-disabled` rule, or the "add a report / consolidator / comparison" recipes. |
| [comparison-engine.md](comparison-engine.md) | You're in `compare_core` — the regression lock + harness, the two flavors, key-field / roadbed key / duplicate-pairing, ditto non-asserting, the verdict / incompleteness contract, write-path safety, the comparison families (including the ArcGIS-sourced ones, §9j Clean Road, §9k–§9l the reports rendered from the layers, §9m the last nine editions (v0.48.0), and their by-day matrix in §12d), the **speed contract** (§2b — the composite-style cache and the streamed package read, both output-locked) and the **counts-only preview** (§2c — what it does and why it can never certify), and the **visual-evidence decoration** (§13 — the five print-crop adapters: Highway Log, Highway Sequence, Intersection Detail, Ramp Detail, and **Highway Detail** since v0.37.0; its env evidence joined in v0.38.3, so all five PDF rows support that lane). |
| [planning/comparison-perfection/README.md](planning/comparison-perfection/README.md) | You want to know **why a comparison behaves the way it does**. The comparison-perfection project's record — **COMPLETE, shipped as v0.28.0**; **246/246 CLOSED** — the HD pre-release block (133 · 142 · 186 · 192 + 045-HD) fell to the vendor's 2026-08-17 release in v0.37.0 / v0.38.0, and subsequent fixes include 244 (v0.38.2), 245 (v0.39.1), and 246 (v0.45.0). Audit ledgers, source bindings, canary bindings and advisory reviews in one folder. It is a record, not a worklist. |
| [planning/comparison-perfection/comparison-phase4-tsn-source-rebaseline.md](planning/comparison-perfection/comparison-phase4-tsn-source-rebaseline.md) | You're auditing or changing a vs-TSN source, normalizer, comparator, or evidence adapter — exact 29-member comparison-truth and 14-member evidence manifests, source roles, member hashes, raw identity facts, known admission defects, and the Phase-4 source-first gates. |
| [highway_log/columns.md](highway_log/columns.md) | You need the corrected 31-column Highway Log labels (the vendor mislabeled most) — `highway_log_columns.py`, tooltips, the Legend sheet. |
| [highway_log/pdf-and-tsn-parsing.md](highway_log/pdf-and-tsn-parsing.md) | You're parsing a Highway Log PDF — the TSMIS cell-rect parser and the TSN character-window parser (with the 3 description guards), the two PDF formats, the flawless-validation results. |
| [highway_log/comparison-study.md](highway_log/comparison-study.md) | You need the `+`/`++` **ditto domain convention** and the raw evidence behind it (the "pointer to the paired roadbed, not data" finding + the roadbed-encoding split §7b). |
| [tsn-parsers.md](tsn-parsers.md) | You need a **non-HL report's TSN format + comparison schema** — the per-report TSN file format, column→TSMIS mapping, key field, normalization, and approved sample counts (filled during v0.17.0). HL's own TSN specifics stay under highway_log/. |
| [build-and-release.md](build-and-release.md) | You're building/packaging/releasing — PyInstaller `app.spec`, `prune_bundle.ps1` + the DLP guard, the three browser-channel variants, the full **updater** (swap mode / MOTW / SHA-256 / revert), and CI (`release.yml` / `checks.yml`). |
| [it-and-security.md](it-and-security.md) | You need the IT/DLP/security view — what the app talks to, files it touches, browser flags, the **work-PC capability model**, the read-only audit's findings + the "good designs," and code-signing. |
| [website.md](website.md) | You're touching the **`gh-pages` landing page** — the single-screen layout, the live-resolving Download button, the System/Light/Dark toggle, screenshot/OG regeneration (`tools/screenshots.py`), favicon, and SEO (sitemap/Search Console). |
| [verification-and-testing.md](verification-and-testing.md) | You need to verify a change — the golden `check_*.py` catalog, the COM-recalc compare loop, the `#mock` preview, the owed live-export, where the real test data + website source live (local only), and the diagnostics. |
| [work-pc-validation.md](work-pc-validation.md) | You're running the **work-PC operational sign-off** (still owed) — the credential-safe `--collect-evidence` kit, the manual fallback, the §K2 work-PC acceptance checklist, and the sign-off process. The current acceptance target and additions are maintained in `project-guide.md` and [planning/v0.30-owner-backlog-plan.md](planning/v0.30-owner-backlog-plan.md) §4; do not use this document's historical v0.18.x narrative as a release target. |
| [vendor-escalations.md](vendor-escalations.md) | A comparison is reporting a defect the app **cannot fix** because it is in the source TSMIS produced — the owner-facing record of each one, what was measured against what, and the exact on-delivery test that closes it. Currently one open: **VEN-01**, route 140's Highway Log Excel export dropping four columns its own print carries. |
| [lessons.md](lessons.md) | You want the project's hard-won judgment — the three field failures, "refactor to one core," regression-lock discipline, "consolidate from raw," "verify agent claims," audit methodology. Distilled; links to the owners. |
| [history.md](history.md) | You want the narrative — how a one-day console script became a self-updating desktop app, the dead ends and reverts, the field failures that rewrote the design, and the four threads running through all of it (17 chapters, through v0.41.0). |
| [roadmap.md](roadmap.md) | **You're picking what to work on next** — the `▣ OPEN WORK INVENTORY` is the definitive remaining-work list (owner-owed acceptance run, vendor/site waits, the ArcGIS findings, output-audit follow-ups, hygiene, and the next large build), with the themed sections below it holding the rationale. |
| [planning/cleanroad-highways.md](planning/cleanroad-highways.md) | You're building or changing a **Clean Road** file from the ArcGIS layers — the measured overlay model, the 74-column THY coverage census, the layer-export input contract, and the already-censused CA INTERSECTIONS / CA RAMPS mappings that the next large build (roadmap G1) starts from. |
| [planning/vs-tsn-comparison-speed.md](planning/vs-tsn-comparison-speed.md) | You're about to make a comparison faster — the v0.40–v0.41 record: what shipped, what was deliberately not taken and why, the measured phase breakdown (writing is 70%), and the benchmarking method that keeps numbers honest on a loaded box. |
| [code-review-prompt.md](code-review-prompt.md) | You're running an audit — the reusable, project-tailored read-only review prompt. |
| [agent-prompts.md](agent-prompts.md) | You're starting the **roadmap-curator** or the **fix-implementer** agent — the post-compact restart line + the fix-implementer prompt. |
| [roadmap-curator.md](roadmap-curator.md) | The **to-do-list manager's** operating manual — point a cloud or local agent at this one file to run the roadmap curator (intake ideas + keep the list synced as patches ship). |

## Internals (deep-dive, for future development)

Code-level walkthroughs under `docs/internals/` — the exhaustive "how it actually works"
companions to the topic docs above (algorithms, data/control flow, edge cases, extension
points), every claim anchored to `file:symbol`.

## Conventions, archive, and external resources

- **Conventions** (console-free core, UI-neutral strings, no AI attribution, never commit
  the auth file, regression-lock discipline, call the timeout accessors, branch off `main`)
  live in [`project-guide.md`](project-guide.md).
- **`CHANGELOG.md`** (repo root) is the user-facing changelog, one section per version.
  `release.yml` publishes each release body from the matching section + the shared
  `build/release_notes_header.md` (via `build/gen_release_notes.py`); history.md is the narrative.
- **Real test data + the live TSMIS website source are LOCAL ONLY** (under
  `C:\Users\Yunus\Downloads\TSMIS\…` on the dev PC) and are **never** committed, copied
  into the repo, or pushed — the website source is Caltrans-internal. Read that
  corpus's `_INDEX.md` before choosing a fixture; see verification-and-testing.md
  for the repo-side rules.
- Durable knowledge belongs in this `docs/` library. Prior session notes were
  incorporated here; a contributor does not need any assistant's private memory
  directory or local configuration to work on the project.
