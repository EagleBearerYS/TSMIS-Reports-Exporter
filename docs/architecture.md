# Architecture

How the TSMIS Reports Exporter is structured — one console-free core driven by two
front-ends, the single report registry, route/run plumbing, the on-disk run-folder
and data-location model, and the high-level feature buckets through the v0.18.0
structural overhaul and the v0.18.1 close-out. Runtime
*behavior* (the export loop, recovery, resume, skip/cancel, timeouts) lives in
[engine-and-reliability.md](engine-and-reliability.md); GUI internals (threading,
pywebview traps, snapshots) live in [gui.md](gui.md).

## Two run modes, one core

The export engine is **console-free** and backs both front-ends:

- **`.bat` console flow** — development + fallback. Same core engine; menus are
  static hand-edited text.
- **Packaged GUI** — a pywebview (**Edge WebView2**) window rendering `scripts/ui/`
  (plain HTML/CSS/JS, no build step / no npm). Entry chain:
  `gui_main.py` (entry) → `gui_api.py` (js_api bridge + state + queue pump) →
  `gui_worker.py` (worker threads, unchanged across the Tk→WebView rewrite).

**Console boundary.** Only `cli.py` and `gui_*.py` touch
`print`/`input`/`msvcrt`/the window. Core code (`common.py`, `exporter.py`,
consolidator cores) reports via the `Events` sink (`scripts/events.py`) and raises
exceptions — never `print`/`input`/`sys.exit`. User-facing strings from the core
must be **UI-neutral**: no `.bat` names, no "this window" / "menu option N" — that
guidance lives in the driver.

The `gui_main.main()` entry first branches into self-update **swap mode**
(`updater.SWAP_FLAG` in `sys.argv`) *before* logging/paths/CLR setup, then calls
`setup_logging(enable_faulthandler=False)`, strips Mark-of-the-Web from bundled
.NET assemblies (`_unblock_dotnet_assemblies`), runs `updater.cleanup_leftovers()`,
imports `gui_api`, and calls `gui_api.run()`. Details of swap mode / MOTW are owned
by [build-and-release.md](build-and-release.md); pywebview traps and the
threading/queue model are owned by [gui.md](gui.md).

### The Events seam (`scripts/events.py`)

The engine never prints, prompts, or exits — it pushes status through an `Events`
sink and returns a `RunResult`. The console shim wires the callbacks to
`print()`/`msvcrt`; the GUI wires them to its queue + widgets. All callbacks default
to harmless no-ops, so `Events()` is a valid silent sink.

| Callback | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `on_log(message)` | Human-readable status line (console prints; GUI appends to log pane). |
| `on_route(route, status)` | Per-route outcome; status ∈ `{saved, empty, skipped, failed, exists}`. |
| `should_skip()` | Return True to skip the route currently being waited on. |
| `is_cancelled()` | Return True to stop the whole run before the next route. |
| `is_paused()` | Return True to HOLD between routes (B1 pause/resume); honored in fast mode too (all workers park). |
| `on_status(worker, text)` | One-line "what this browser is doing now" — statuses REPLACE, log lines accumulate. |
| `screenshot_wanted(worker) -> bool` | Polled at safe points on the worker's own thread (Playwright is thread-affine); must clear the request before returning True (one request = one shot). |
| `on_screenshot(worker, image, note, url)` | Requested capture — `image` is JPEG bytes (or None on failure; `note` says why), `url` the address at capture time. |
| `worker_no` | Which browser this sink reports for — 1 in the sequential engine; fast mode wraps the shared sink in per-worker `Events` carrying each worker's number. |

**Result types** (also in `events.py`):

- `RunResult` — `saved` (count), `empty` / `user_skipped` / `failed` / `exists`
  (route lists), `output_dir`, `per_route` (ordered `(route, status)` behind the
  saved run report), `report_path` (where the run-report CSV was auto-saved).
- `ConsolidateResult` — `status` ∈ `{"ok", "cancelled", "error"}`, `message`,
  `output_path`, `summary_lines`, `verdict` (`None | "match" | "diff"` — comparisons
  only; the GUI keys its quick-result dialog on it, consolidators leave it None).

## One shared loop, per-report `ReportSpec`

Each report's differences live in a `ReportSpec` — `label` (the option text / `data-label`),
`data_value` (the stable option id, matched first — v0.18.1), output filename, `subdir`,
post-Generate `wait_js`, `is_empty` check, and `save` strategy. The proven per-route loop, recovery, and skip/cancel logic live **once**
in `exporter.py` (`run_export(spec, events)`, `save_pdf_letter` /
`save_via_export_button`, `_recover`, `_retry_failed_routes`). To fix one report's
behavior, edit only its `ReportSpec`. See
[engine-and-reliability.md](engine-and-reliability.md) for the loop internals and
[reports.md](reports.md) for the per-report spec details.

Each `export_<name>.py` module is thin (~30 lines): a `ReportSpec` + `run_cli`.

## Single report registry (`report_catalog.py` → `reports.py`)

`report_catalog.py` is the single source of truth for report metadata (P4); `reports.py`
**derives** the GUI/console registry lists from it, so the lists can't drift.
`export_multi.py` imports `EXPORT_REPORTS`; `gui_api.py` reads the registry lists
(`EXPORT_REPORTS`, `CONSOLIDATE_REPORTS`, `COMPARE_REPORTS`) plus `COMPARE_GROUPS`;
`tsn_library` derives its TSN descriptors from the same catalog. The console
`4. consolidate…bat` menu keeps its own text, but a parity check
(`build/check_report_catalog.py`) now enforces that it covers exactly the registry's
consolidators (a golden-equivalence baseline there also proves the derived lists equal the
v0.17 snapshot). Both modules are console-free: importing them never launches a browser or
does application runtime I/O — though (as the literal registry always did) they eagerly
import the report implementation modules, transitively openpyxl/pdfplumber/playwright.

Four data structures:

**`EXPORT_REPORTS`** — `(menu label, format hint, ReportSpec)`. Console menu numbering
follows this order; the **GUI picker** order is the catalog's `_PICKER_ORDER` (website-style
grouping, v0.18.1 — see [reports.md](reports.md)). The table below is the v0.19.x
core; the later editions (v0.24.0 → v0.45.2, ending with the Clean Road print
editions at stable ids 20/21/22) and each one's current consolidate/compare status
are in [reports.md](reports.md), which is authoritative:

| Label | Format | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `TSAR: Ramp Summary` | PDF | |
| `TSAR: Ramp Detail` | Excel | |
| `Highway Sequence Listing` | Excel | |
| `Highway Log` | Excel | |
| `Highway Log (PDF)` | PDF | Same "Highway Log" dropdown option, saved via the page's Print layout (`hl_printAll`) instead of the Excel Export button. Has its own PDF-sourced consolidator + PDF-vs-TSN / PDF-vs-Excel compares (it is NOT auto-consolidated inline — the matrix handles it via a scratch convert dir). |
| `Intersection Summary` | Excel | Consolidates + compares (cross-env + vs-TSN) since v0.17.0. No `TSAR:` prefix. |
| `Intersection Detail` | Excel | Consolidates + compares (cross-env + vs-TSN) since v0.17.0. |
| `Intersection Detail (PDF)` | PDF | Same "Intersection Detail" dropdown option, saved via Print layout (`intd_printAll`) — the exact parallel of Highway Log (PDF), forward-ported in v0.18.0. **Appended at index 7** so the 7 existing export-op keys keep positions 0–6 (the manifest-v1 integer-index compat contract, CR-002-RM4); the Highway pair follows at 8/9. Has its own PDF-sourced consolidator + PDF-vs-TSN / PDF-vs-Excel compares. |
| `Highway Detail` | Excel | Export v0.19.1; **consolidates + compares (cross-env + vs-TSN + PDF↔Excel) since v0.20.0** — schema verified against the full statewide bundle. Append-only stable id **8**; `save_via_export_button`. Where the live site still greys it, `select_report` fails fast (`ReportUnavailableError`) rather than stalling. |
| `Highway Summary` | Excel | **Export-enabled (v0.19.1); consolidate/compare pending.** Append-only stable id **9**; the `export_highway_summary` parallel of the above (still `cs-disabled` on the site, so it fail-fasts until the vendor enables it — its integration waits for a real export to verify a schema against). |
| `Highway Detail (PDF)` | PDF | **v0.19.2.** Same "Highway Detail" dropdown option saved via Print layout (`hd_printAll`, the `.hl-print-section` twin of Highway Log (PDF)); `save_highway_detail_pdf`. Append-only stable id **10**; since v0.20.0 it has its own PDF-sourced consolidator + PDF-vs-TSN / PDF-vs-Excel compares (like the other PDF editions, matrix-handled via a scratch convert dir). |

**Coalescing (v0.19.2; fast mode + matrix since v0.32.0):** selecting both editions of one on-site report (Excel + its PDF, same `data_value`) generates the report ONCE per route and saves both — `ExportWorker._run_specs` groups by `data_value` and runs the pair through `exporter.run_export_combined` sequentially or `exporter_parallel.run_export_parallel_combined` in fast mode (Export-button save first, DOM-rebuilding PDF save last; N browsers over routes in fast mode). Matrix-queued export steps coalesce the same way per environment (`MatrixBatchExportWorker._grouped_steps`), so one pass fills both cells. See [reports.md](reports.md) and [engine-and-reliability.md](engine-and-reliability.md).

**`CONSOLIDATE_REPORTS`** — `(menu label, module)`. Each module exposes
`consolidate(events, confirm_overwrite, day=None)` plus `input_dir_for(day)` /
`out_path_for(day)` (paths are day-dependent now that exports group into run
folders, so the registry hands out the module, not a precomputed `OUT_PATH`).
Each PDF-sourced consolidator is grouped next to its Excel sibling; the three
Highway Log consolidators are TSMIS-before-TSN with source-explicit labels:

| Label | Module | Input |
|---|---|---|
| `TSAR: Ramp Summary` | `consolidate_ramp_summary` | |
| `TSAR: Ramp Detail` | `consolidate_ramp_detail` | |
| `Highway Sequence Listing` | `consolidate_highway_sequence` | |
| `Intersection Summary` | `consolidate_intersection_summary` | TSMIS "Intersection Summary" Excel export (day-aware). |
| `Intersection Detail` | `consolidate_intersection_detail` | TSMIS "Intersection Detail" Excel export (day-aware). |
| `TSMIS Intersection Detail (PDF)` | `consolidate_tsmis_intersection_detail_pdf` | this app's own "Intersection Detail (PDF)" export, parsed into the same 35-column July-2026 format as the Excel export (pre-update prints are refused with a re-export hint). |
| `TSMIS Highway Log (Excel)` | `consolidate_highway_log` | TSMIS "Highway Log" Excel export, `output/<run>/highway_log/` (day-aware). |
| `TSMIS Highway Log (PDF)` | `consolidate_tsmis_highway_log_pdf` | TSMIS "Highway Log (PDF)" export, `output/<run>/highway_log_pdf/` (day-aware, this app's own export). |
| `TSN Highway Log (PDF)` | `consolidate_tsn_highway_log` | TSN district PDFs dropped in `tsn_library/highway_log/raw/` (from outside the app — the one drop location since v0.30.0 retired `input/`; `day` ignored). |

See [highway_log/pdf-and-tsn-parsing.md](highway_log/pdf-and-tsn-parsing.md) for the
PDF parsers.

**`COMPARE_GROUPS`** — the Compare-pane sub-tabs, in order (first = default):
`("env", "Cross-environment")`, `("tsn", "vs TSN")`, and (CMP-AUD-014)
`("self", "Self-consistency")` (the GUI appends two more — the "vs TSN Matrix",
and since v0.26.0 the "vs Baseline Matrix", the day-vs-baseline matrix over
`baseline_matrix.py`). Cross-env folder compares sit in `env`; the file-based
TSMIS-vs-TSN compares sit in `tsn`; the eleven PDF-vs-Excel self-checks (a report's
PDF render vs its Excel render — one system, one environment, neither
cross-environment nor vs-TSN) sit in their own `self` group. Every report is wired
as of v0.17.0/v0.18.0.

**`COMPARE_REPORTS`** — `(menu label, module/adapter, input kind, group)`. `kind` is
`"files"` (two workbooks) or `"folders"` (two export run folders); `group` is one of
`COMPARE_GROUPS`' ids. As of P3 (v0.18.0) selection travels by each row's stable
`cmp:*` key (`COMPARE_KEYS`), so this order is only the UI-radio display order, not the
contract `start_compare*` calls key on:

The full set (29 rows; the env-folder rows first, since they drive the matrix, then
the file-based vs-TSN / self rows — `cmp:*` key shown for the stable contract):

| Label | Module / adapter | Kind | Group |
|---|---|---|---|
| `TSAR: Ramp Summary — between environments` | `compare_env.RAMP_SUMMARY` | folders | env |
| `TSAR: Ramp Detail — between environments` | `compare_env.RAMP_DETAIL` | folders | env |
| `Highway Sequence Listing — between environments` | `compare_env.HIGHWAY_SEQUENCE` | folders | env |
| `Highway Log — between environments` | `compare_env.HIGHWAY_LOG` | folders | env |
| `Intersection Summary — between environments` | `compare_env.INTERSECTION_SUMMARY` | folders | env |
| `Intersection Detail — between environments` | `compare_env.INTERSECTION_DETAIL` | folders | env |
| `Highway Log (PDF) — between environments` | `compare_env.HIGHWAY_LOG_PDF` | folders | env |
| `Intersection Detail (PDF) — between environments` | `compare_env.INTERSECTION_DETAIL_PDF` | folders | env |
| `Highway Log — TSMIS vs TSN` | `compare_highway_log` | files | tsn |
| `Highway Log — TSMIS (PDF) vs TSN (PDF)` | `compare_highway_log_pdf.TSMIS_PDF_VS_TSN` | files | tsn |
| `Highway Log — TSMIS (PDF) vs TSMIS (Excel)` | `compare_highway_log_pdf.TSMIS_PDF_VS_EXCEL` | files | self |
| `TSAR: Ramp Detail — TSMIS vs TSN` | `compare_ramp_detail_tsn` | files | tsn |
| `TSAR: Ramp Summary — TSMIS vs TSN` | `compare_ramp_summary_tsn` | files | tsn |
| `Intersection Summary — TSMIS vs TSN` | `compare_intersection_summary_tsn` | files | tsn |
| `Intersection Detail — TSMIS vs TSN` | `compare_intersection_detail_tsn` | files | tsn |
| `Intersection Detail — TSMIS (PDF) vs TSN` | `compare_intersection_detail_pdf.TSMIS_PDF_VS_TSN` | files | tsn |
| `Intersection Detail — TSMIS (PDF) vs TSMIS (Excel)` | `compare_intersection_detail_pdf.TSMIS_PDF_VS_EXCEL` | files | self |
| `Highway Sequence Listing — TSMIS vs TSN` | `compare_highway_sequence_tsn` | files | tsn |

The comparison engine itself is owned by
[comparison-engine.md](comparison-engine.md); the five non-HL file comparators share
the `compare_tsn_common` substrate (`norm_pm` / `iso_date` / `make_notes_writer` /
`run_files_compare`).

**`consolidator_by_subdir()` / `consolidator_for_spec(spec)`** — used by B2
auto-consolidate; maps an export `ReportSpec` to its consolidate module **by the
spec's output subdir** so it can't drift from the lists above. The map holds the six
Excel-export families (incl. Intersection Summary/Detail since v0.17.0); the two PDF
editions (`highway_log_pdf`, `intersection_detail_pdf`) are absent (→ None) because
they need a scratch convert dir — the matrix / auto-consolidate handles them specially.

## Route selection

Route selection is per-run plumbing into `run_export(..., routes=ROUTES)`.
`common.parse_routes` (`common.py:313`) is the one parser. The route universe is
`ROUTES` in `common.py` (`common.py:270`, zero-padded 3-digit values, optional
suffixes like `"005S"`/`"101U"` matching the TSMIS `<select>` option values) — edit
it to change the route universe permanently.

- **Console:** `_resolve_routes_console` (Enter / `all` / EOF = all; honors
  `TSMIS_ROUTES`).
- **GUI:** a Routes entry + `Choose…` picker.

## Multi-report runs

A multi-report run runs each selected `ReportSpec` in turn through the same engine
(so at most `workers` browsers are ever open at once), each spec with its own
browser, preflight, and run-report CSV.

## Run folders (v0.10.0; replaces bare dated outputs; site tag v0.49.0)

Every run writes into `output/<YYYY-MM-DD src-env host-site>/<report>/`
(`paths.output_run_dir`; src/env from `common.get_site()` at run start, the host
from the address the run opens). Each day's exports live in their own folder,
different source/environment combinations never mix, AND an export from the **dev
site** never lands in the same folder as one from the **main site** — the folder
name says exactly what's inside, which every comparison keys on (e.g.
`2026-10-07 ssor-prod dev-site`). Reports wait on the dev site
(`tsmis-dev.dot.ca.gov`) until they are approved and move to the main site
(`tsmis.dot.ca.gov`), so the same source and environment can be exported from
either, and the two are different evidence. The tag is `main-site` / `dev-site` /
`other-site` (`site_target.host_kind`: a Settings custom address on any other host
reads as `other`; its exact address is in the run report's Site column and the
log). A `<date> <src>-<env>` folder from v0.10–v0.48 never recorded its site and
reads as **site not recorded**.

| Helper (`scripts/paths.py`) | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `run_folder_name(src, env, day=None, host=None)` | The run-folder name; `day=None` = today; `host` adds the site tag (None = the untagged pre-v0.49 spelling readers still look for). |
| `output_run_dir(src, env, day=None, host=None)` | `output/<day src-env host-site>/` — where an export writes; `host=None` = the host (src, env) points at right now (`site_target.host_kind_for`). |
| `parse_run_folder(name)` | `(date, src, env)` or None. Legacy bare-date folders (pre-v0.10) read as the old defaults **ssor-prod** (regex `_RUN_RE` makes the ` <src>-<env>` suffix, and the ` <host>-site` tag after it, optional). |
| `run_folder_host(name)` | `'main'` / `'dev'` / `'other'` from the tag, or None (site not recorded / not a run folder). |
| `day_source_dir(date, source, host=None)` | The folder a matrix column reads: that host's own folder, else the unrecorded `<date> <source>` one, else the pre-v0.10 bare date — **never another site's**. |
| `day_run_label(date, source, host=None)` / `run_days_for(source, host=None)` | The name that folder carries (what the matrices' comparison files and cache records are named after) / every day a source has such a folder, newest first (the matrices' day pickers). |
| `list_output_days()` | Existing run/legacy folders, newest first. |
| `latest_output_day()` | Newest run-folder name, or None. |
| `list_output_days_for_report(subdir)` | Run folders that actually contain non-empty `<subdir>/` files — the A2 cross-env compare-folder filter. |
| `resolve_day_choice(raw)` | Maps a `TSMIS_DAY` value (exact folder name, or a bare date → that date's newest run folder) to a folder. |

Consolidators take the run-folder NAME as their `day` argument (opaque string;
newest by default via `latest_output_day()`). The GUI picker lists run folders; the
console prompts (Enter = newest; `TSMIS_DAY` accepts a folder name or a bare date).
The combined workbook lands in `output/<run>/consolidated/`. When **no** run folders
exist, consolidators fall back to the legacy flat `output/<report>/` layout, so
pre-0.7 exports stay consolidatable. Resume/idempotency, the integrity gate, and
live browser status are runtime behavior — see
[engine-and-reliability.md](engine-and-reliability.md).

**Which site the matrices read (v0.49.0; picked in the matrix since v0.49.1).** The
by-day matrices (vs TSN, vs Baseline, PDF vs Excel, Reports vs ArcGIS) keep their
`(source, date)` columns, and the SOURCE names the site as well:
`ssor-prod dev-site` (`paths.split_day_source` / `qualify_day_source`). Every
data source and environment is offered on the main site and on the dev site
(`matrix.day_source_keys`, labelled `SSOR / Prod · dev site`), whichever site the
app points at — v0.49.0 offered only the site Settings pointed at, which hid the
dev-site exports as soon as the app was switched back to the main site. Each
column reads the folder `day_source_dir` picks for that site, plus the folders from
before the site was recorded, which could be from either site. A dev-site day and a
main-site day therefore never share a comparison file or a cache record (their
names follow the folder: `ramp_detail_vs_tsn 2026-10-07 ssor-prod dev-site.xlsx`),
and every day column says which site its export records (or "site not
recorded"). A saved bare `ssor-prod` (v0.49.0 and older) reads as the site that
pair points at now. **Today's column exports only from the site the app points
at** (the export opens that address): a matrix showing the other site's exports
compares them but offers no export (`day_source_exportable`; the bridge refuses
with the reason). A dev-vs-main comparison of one report is the Compare tab's
folders mode, whose side labels then read `SSOR-PROD DEV` / `SSOR-PROD MAIN`.

Artifact directories expose deliverables at their top level and group durable
machine state under one `_state/` child. Outcome/provenance sidecars, compressed
comparison payloads, publication locks, evidence manifests, fingerprints, and
Matrix caches all follow that convention. Readers retain legacy sibling-path
compatibility; startup organizes known legacy state conservatively. See
[engine-and-reliability.md](engine-and-reliability.md#clean-artifact-folders-_state).

## Data location (option A): next to the exe, `%LOCALAPPDATA%` fallback

`scripts/paths.py` decides WHERE the app reads/writes, so the rest of the code never
cares whether it's a dev script or the packaged exe. Resolved once at import time.

- **Packaged build** (`sys.frozen`): write next to the `.exe`
  (`DATA_ROOT = Path(sys.executable).parent`). If that folder is not writable (e.g.
  unzipped into Program Files or a read-only network share), fall back automatically
  to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\TSMIS Exporter` (`APP_NAME = "TSMIS Exporter"`). Callers
  surface `DATA_ROOT` in the UI so the rare fallback is never a mystery.
- **Dev / `.bat`** (not frozen): `DATA_ROOT` = repo root; `output/` and
  `scripts/tsmis_auth.json` keep their original locations so existing scripts
  behave exactly as before.

Derived paths: `OUTPUT_ROOT = DATA_ROOT/output`, `INPUT_ROOT = DATA_ROOT/input`
(user-supplied input — currently TSN district PDFs; TSMIS reports never read from
here). Two libraries sit beside them, both git-ignored and never written by an
export run: `TSN_LIBRARY_ROOT = DATA_ROOT/tsn_library` (the report-shaped TSN
ground truth, stocked by hand — §v0.17.0 below) and `ARCGIS_LAYERS_ROOT =
DATA_ROOT/arcgis_layers` (`scripts/arcgis_layers.py`, 2026-07-22 — the TSMIS
ArcGIS layers, which is what every TSMIS report is ultimately made of; ONE `.xlsx`
per layer named `NN_<Layer Name>.xlsx` beside a `00_INDEX.xlsx` manifest — the
filename is the identity because Excel truncates sheet names at 31 chars, and the
INDEX carries each layer's row/field counts + FeatureServer source for audit, plus
since v0.46.0 each layer's Exported At / Exported By). Stocked by hand until
v0.46.0; since then the **ArcGIS ▸ Layers** tab refreshes it in-app:
`arcgis_pro.py` finds ArcGIS Pro's own `arcgispro-py3` python.exe and runs
`scripts/arcgis_worker/export_layers.py` in it (ArcPy cannot ship in the bundle,
so the worker is a plain `.py` data file run as a separate process — the Project
Inspector's proven pattern), and `arcgis_refresh.py` checks each exported layer,
swaps it in (replaced files → `arcgis_layers/_previous/`) and rewrites the INDEX —
see [gui.md](gui.md) "The ArcGIS tab".
Since **v0.29.0 the ArcGIS TAB consumes it**: `clean_road_layers.py` verifies the
drop against the 40-layer manifest + the INDEX row counts,
`consolidate_clean_highway.py` builds OUR own 74-column CA HIGHWAYS clean-road
table from the layers (county+PM overlay, as-of the TSN extract's date) into
`output/arcgis_cleanroad/`, and `compare_clean_highway_tsn.py` diffs it against
the TSN extract — see [comparison-engine.md](comparison-engine.md) §9j and
[planning/cleanroad-highways.md](planning/cleanroad-highways.md). Since
2026-09-02 the tab renders every report in the `arcgis_reports` registry from
the layers — ONE build per report under `output/arcgis_reports/`, stamped with the
drop it came from (`arcgis_layers.drop_info`: the oldest layer's export time + a
content fingerprint over the `.xlsx` files), held and refreshed on the **ArcGIS
reports** sub-tab since v0.47.0 — and the **Reports vs ArcGIS matrix**
(`arcgis_matrix.py`, §12d; *Reports vs layers* until v0.47.0) compares every export
edition of each report, Excel and PDF alike, against its build for each exported
day. App-private data (`_PRIVATE` = `DATA_ROOT/data` when frozen, else `DATA_ROOT`):
`AUTH`, `LOG_DIR`, `FAILURES_DIR`, `CONFIG_FILE`, `UPDATE_DIR`,
`EDGE_LOGIN_PROFILE_DIR`, `WEBVIEW_PROFILE_DIR`, `DOWNLOADED_BROWSERS_DIR`. The
frozen auth file is `data/tsmis_auth.json`; the dev auth file is
`scripts/tsmis_auth.json` (git-ignored, treat as a credential). `paths.py` also
points `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` at the bundled `_internal/ms-playwright` (with-browser
variant) or the Settings-downloaded `DOWNLOADED_BROWSERS_DIR`, unless one is already
set — browser-channel detail is owned by
[build-and-release.md](build-and-release.md).

Two output-filename helpers: `stamped_consolidated_filename(filename, day)` (A1 —
stamps the run folder's `<date> <src>-<env> <host>-site` provenance into a consolidated workbook's name; returns
unchanged for None / legacy-flat `day`) and `env_tagged_filename(filename, tag)`
(Export-Everything — FRONT-stamps the `<src-env>` subfolder name; FRONT on purpose
so the consolidators' `*.xlsx`/`*.pdf` glob + end-anchored `_route_(\w+)\.xlsx$`
route parser keep matching).

## Settings (`scripts/settings.py`)

Persisted user settings in `config.json` under the app's private data dir
(`CONFIG_FILE`). Consumers read through accessor functions at **run time** (not
import time), so a change applies to the next run without restarting; precedence is
explicit function args / `TSMIS_*` env vars (where one exists) > the file > built-in
defaults. The console flow gets the same overrides because `common.py` reads through
here (and so `settings.py` must never import `common`). Tolerant by design: a
missing/broken `config.json` silently means "defaults" (a corrupt file is moved
aside to `config.json.corrupt` first), writes go through a temp file + `os.replace`,
unknown keys survive round-trips.

`DEFAULTS` (numeric ones clamped to `_RANGES`): `report_timeout_min` 6,
`fast_timeout_min` 10, `retry_timeout_min` 15, `county_timeout_s` 60,
`download_start_timeout_s` 60, `fast_workers` 3, `debug_logging` False,
`ui_devtools` False, `env_check_after_signin` True, `env_check_after_start` False,
`notify_on_finish` True. Plus non-scalar state: per-env URL overrides under
`site_urls` (validated https + `*.ca.gov` host + matching `?env=`/`?src=` params;
consulted by `common.get_url()` on every navigation) and the Export-Everything
destination under `batch_dest` (`get/set_batch_dest`, default
`output/All Reports (current)`). The full Settings *tab* (env-access scan, browser
download, support bundle, Delete-all-reports, etc.) is described at a high level
under the feature buckets below; its UI mechanics belong to [gui.md](gui.md).

Explicit TSN picks are not stored as bare paths. `matrix_tsn_files` is read through
`get_matrix_tsn_selections()` as versioned selection records carrying canonical path,
content hash, size/mtime, and file identity. A legacy/path-only, missing, unreadable,
or replaced selection is a durable blocked state until the user re-picks or clears it.

## Feature buckets — the structural record (v0.12.0 → v0.18.1)

**This section is a historical record, not the current shape of the app.** It
captures how each early feature bucket plugged into the core, and the contracts it
established are still live — but the app has grown five more tabs' worth of
surfaces since. For what the app *is* today, read **[The app today](#the-app-today)**
at the end of this file. Runtime details and the GUI mechanics are owned by
[engine-and-reliability.md](engine-and-reliability.md) and [gui.md](gui.md); this is
the "what is it and where does it plug in" map.

### v0.12.0 — output labeling, run control, batch export (roadmap A+B; A3 deferred)

| Feature | What it is | Where it plugs in |
|---|---|---|
| **A1 self-describing filenames** | Consolidated workbooks stamp the run folder's name (`<date> <src>-<env> <host>-site` since v0.49.0) into the filename; both comparison families append a generated-on date in `suggest_name`. TSN Highway Log exempt (no src/env, undated input); legacy flat layout keeps its fixed name. `compare_core/_SCHEMA` text untouched (regression-locked). | `paths.stamped_consolidated_filename` via every `consolidate_*.out_path_for`. Lock: `build/check_a1_filenames.py`. |
| **A2 compare-folder filter** | Cross-env compare folder dropdowns list only runs that actually contain the chosen report (server-side; Browse paths skip the filter). | `paths.list_output_days_for_report` + `GuiApi.get_compare_folders`; `start_compare_env` preflights it. Lock: `build/check_a2_compare_filter.py`. |
| **B1 Pause/Resume** | Holds BETWEEN routes (never inside a thread-affine Playwright wait), in both sequential and parallel engines — so it WORKS in fast mode (all workers park), unlike Skip. | `Events.is_paused` (8th callback) + shared `exporter._wait_while_paused`; `GuiApi.pause_or_resume` toggles `pause_event`, cleared on cancel and at end-of-task. Lock: `build/check_b1_pause.py`. |
| **B2 auto-consolidate** | One Export-tab toggle; `ExportWorker` runs the matching consolidator INLINE after each spec's export (reuses the held task slot + same Events sink). The two PDF editions (Highway Log (PDF) + Intersection Detail (PDF)) have no inline auto-consolidator → skipped (they need a scratch convert dir, so the matrix / auto-consolidate handles them specially; every other report, incl. both Intersection **Excel** reports, consolidates inline as of v0.17.0); failures logged, never fatal. | `reports.consolidator_for_spec` maps export→consolidate by subdir. Lock: `build/check_b2_autoconsolidate.py`. |
| **B3 Export Everything (always-current store)** | The **Everything** tab runs selected report types × selected environments SEQUENTIALLY into a configurable, UNDATED, overwritten-in-place destination (always holds the latest of every report), laid out `<dest>/<src-env>/<report>/` (+ `consolidated/`). Each report+env folder is refreshed via **STAGE-AND-SWAP** (`_swap_store_dir`): the export writes into a `.staging` sibling and replaces the live folder only on a clean finish (discarded on cancel/crash), so a failed refresh never destroys the last-good copy — the Phase-3 fix for `auto-consolidate-rmtree-out-dir-before-export`. Reuses B1 pause + B2 auto-consolidate. | `gui_worker.BatchWorker` (per-env, reusing `ExportWorker._run_specs`); per-env targeting via process-global `common.set_site` (NOT `set_thread_site` — a single sequential orchestrator under the single-task gate; original restored at end). Dest = `settings.get/set_batch_dest`. Saved-reports freshness library via `report_library.report_ages` + `GuiApi.report_library_info`. Progress persists to `batch_manifest` (`DATA_ROOT/batch_job.json`, atomic, untouched by Delete-all-reports) → resumes across restarts (startup Resume/Discard banner). Locks: `build/check_b3_batch.py` + `check_report_library.py`. |

**Phase-1 destination ownership.** User-selected store children are create-only,
purpose-marked `OwnershipLease` roots; existing unowned or legacy-marked folders are
never adopted. `.staging` is exclusively created, plain, and identity-bound. Export
saves, consolidation/PDF scratch, sidecars, promotion journals/recovery, Matrix caches,
and evidence receive a target-aware guard that rejects a changed root or any reparse
component. Everything comparisons use a comparisons lease plus a lazily acquired
existing environment-store lease for TSN/self cells; Day/Baseline outputs are
app-private and never claim the batch destination. Reset binds its preview to exact
entry/root identities, quarantines the same entry under an unpredictable same-parent
name, and retains/restores on drift. Portable pathname checks leave an irreducible
syscall-sized Windows race; every surrounding boundary fails closed.

A3 (results tab) was deferred. **The current GUI is a stopgap** — a full GUI
overhaul is planned (the user designs it elsewhere and will hand it over). Fix bugs,
but DON'T invest in redesigning the current layout (mock candidates were rejected).

> **⚠ Age check (2026-08-20).** That "stopgap" ruling dates from **v0.13.0, June
> 2026**, and it has shaped decisions ever since (it is why `app.js` was split only
> so far). Nearly thirty releases later no overhaul has been handed over, and the
> "current layout" it refers to has since grown two whole tabs and four matrices.
> **It is still the owner's call, not ours** — so do not treat it as revoked. But
> do not treat it as fresh either: if a UI question turns on it, ask, rather than
> inheriting a fifteen-month-old assumption.

### v0.13.0 — interface declutter, run lifecycle, accessibility & self-revert

A UI/UX + trust release (the planned A3/D1 bucket was pushed down to v0.14.0). At a
structural level:

- **Right-column run lifecycle** — idle: a pre-flight summary of what the active tab
  will do; during a run: a progress card with a live ETA (EMA over per-item times,
  reset when `progress.done===0`); after: a persistent completion summary with **Open
  run folder** and **Retry failed routes** (de-duped failed list).
  `gui_api._build_export_summary` → snapshot `last_summary`/`last_run_folder`.
- **Progress hierarchy** — PRIMARY/SECONDARY lines plus, for Export Everything, a
  per-environment stepper (one pill per env: done/running/pending). Backend ships the
  ordered per-env state list in `batch_progress` (`BatchWorker._step_views`, read from
  the manifest so it's correct across a resume).
- **Completion notification** (default on) — taskbar flash via
  `gui_api._flash_taskbar` (`FlashWindowEx`); toggled by `notify_on_finish`.
- **Compare sub-tabs** (`COMPARE_GROUPS`): Cross-environment (default), vs TSN,
  and Self-consistency (the eleven PDF-vs-Excel self-checks; CMP-AUD-014).
- **Revert to the previous version** (Settings ▸ Debugging) — reinstalls the newest
  full release strictly older than this build through the same SHA-verified
  download→stage→swap pipeline. Owned by
  [build-and-release.md](build-and-release.md).
- **Env-check setting split** — `env_check_after_signin` (ON) + `env_check_after_start`
  (OFF); `gui_api._maybe_autoscan(reason)` keys off which event fired.
- **Everything tab brought to convention** — greys with other tabs during any task;
  output files env-labeled via `paths.env_tagged_filename` (FRONT-stamped); env-access
  verdicts colour-coded in the tab.
- **Accessibility** — keyboard-focusable checkboxes (sr-only clipped input + visible
  focus ring), colour-plus-glyph status icons, aria-labels on icon-only controls.

### This update — the cross-environment comparison matrix

A report × environment **comparison matrix** lives on its own **sub-tab** of the
Everything tab (sibling to *Refresh & export*) and goes full-width (the activity
column animates down to a slim log + a config zone). It sits ON TOP of the
always-current store and **orchestrates the existing comparison adapters
(`compare_env` / `compare_highway_log` / `compare_highway_log_pdf` /
`compare_intersection_detail_pdf`) without editing them**. **5 rows** at the time
(**8 as of v0.18.0** — every report incl. Intersection Detail (PDF); nothing greyed),
each with a per-row
**comparison-mode** dropdown: cross-environment, **vs TSN** (Excel/PDF flavors), and
**TSMIS PDF-vs-Excel** (the "greyed where no code exists" is now defensive — all coded). Cells show the **discrepancy
count, colour-coded**, with per-cell/row/column/all refresh (cancellable + resumable),
report + **environment-column** toggles (config zone), TSN drops in
`<dest>/_tsn_input/`, and TSN/cross-format sheets in `<dest>/comparisons/tsn/`. New
module `scripts/matrix.py` (console-free engine); freshness via
`report_library.cell_ages`; intersection reports were **shown greyed/unpickable** at
this version via one `reports` gate (`DISABLED_EXPORT_SUBDIRS` / `export_reports_status`)
— **v0.17.0 enabled them** (on the dev site), clearing the intersection reports from
`DISABLED_EXPORT_SUBDIRS`; the gate stays live as defensive groundwork and now holds only
the reserved **Route History** placeholder (id 15, v0.25.1 — no export flow yet).
A light app-wide motion layer (pane/popover/modal enters, button press, a slow theme
cross-fade) lands with it. Engine internals are owned by
[comparison-engine.md](comparison-engine.md) §12; the UI + bridge + motion by
[gui.md](gui.md). (This delivers a slice of the parked A3 file-browser intent;
A3 stays parked.)

**v0.16.0 extends the matrix in two ways.** (1) Matrix actions now flow through a
**matrix-scoped job queue** in front of the single-task gate — a 2nd action queues
(reorder/remove/clear/stop-all), jobs auto-advance, row/column headers gain distinct
↻ re-export + ⟳ rebuild buttons, and re-exports support **fast mode**
(`MatrixBatchExportWorker`). (2) A **second matrix** lives under the **Compare** tab —
the manual **"vs TSN Matrix"** (`scripts/day_matrix.py`; the sub-tab was "TSN by day"):
rows = EVERY report (HL wired then; all reports wired as of v0.17.0), columns =
exported days, each cell = (report, day) vs TSN; no cross-env, no live re-export.
The two matrices **share** the TSN compare path (`matrix.consolidate_and_compare_tsn`,
factored out — byte-identical to the prior output), the TSN dataset/picker, and the
ONE job queue (a `which:env|day` Job discriminator routes to the right worker). Engine
+ store details: [comparison-engine.md](comparison-engine.md) §12/§12b.

### v0.17.0 — the canonical TSN library + per-row `tsn_subdir`

The seven canonical TSN datasets essentially never change, so v0.17.0 gives them **one fixed home**
instead of scattering them across drop folders: `scripts/tsn_library.py` over
`<DATA_ROOT>/tsn_library/<report>/` (`raw/` = the raw TSN file(s) as exported — district
PDFs / a statewide PDF / a statewide XLSX, the format is the report's own; `consolidated/`
= the generated consolidated/normalized Excel, built once and reused since a couple of TSN
reports are PDFs). Paths come from `paths.tsn_library_{dir,raw_dir,consolidated_path}`.
The module is console-free with **lazy** consolidator/builder *invocation* (the `build_into`
parse is deferred to call time); as of P4 it imports `report_catalog`, which transitively pulls
openpyxl/pdfplumber, so importing it is console-free but not dependency-light. It exposes
`status`/`all_status` (raw present? consolidated present? current vs the raw?), `import_raw`,
`build_consolidated` (reuses when current), and **`resolve`** —
the matrices' single TSN entry point, returning the same `{kind: file|consolidated|pdfs|
raw|none, …}` contract as before.

`matrix.tsn_source` now **delegates to `tsn_library.resolve`**. In automatic mode the
canonical library wins, followed by the legacy fallbacks (`<dest>/_tsn_input/<report>/`,
then the old global consolidated `output/tsn_highway_log_consolidated.xlsx`) so existing
installs keep working until imported — the raw `input/tsn_highway_log/` drop itself was
retired in v0.30.0 (`tsn_library/highway_log/raw/` is the one drop location). An explicit user pick (`settings.matrix_tsn_files`, keyed
by report) is a versioned, identity-bound selection: it wins while current, and a
missing/replaced/legacy path-only selection blocks dependent comparisons until the user
re-picks or clears it—it never silently falls through to another dataset. The report key IS the per-row **`tsn_subdir`**
(`matrix.tsn_subdir_for`): **each PDF edition shares its Excel sibling's subdir** — both Highway Log
rows share `highway_log` and `intersection_detail_pdf` shares `intersection_detail` — so one TSN
dataset serves both rows of a report; every other report uses its own. This replaced
`day_matrix.TSN_SUBDIR` (deleted) — the by-day matrix now
resolves TSN per row, so plugging in a report is just registering it + flipping `supported`.

### v0.18.0 — structural & engineering overhaul

A maintainability/reliability release: few user-visible features (one new report), a
large internal restructuring, and packaging/updater hardening. The day-to-day behavior
is preserved; the structure and the safety contracts changed. The "what changed and
where it lives" map — each item owned by the doc named:

| Area | What changed | Owner doc |
|---|---|---|
| **Outcome contract** | An orthogonal, producer-owned completion × artifact model (`outcome.py`): a partial/failed/cancelled run is never promoted, cached, or shown green; counts (not text) decide. | [engine-and-reliability.md](engine-and-reliability.md) |
| **Transactional artifacts** | Workbooks use exclusively reserved identity-bound temps, source/output-alias rejection, target-aware guards, validation, then `os.replace`; last-good survives failures. `consolidation_meta.py` records completion, `cache_envelope.py` versions Matrix caches, and `artifact_store.py` owns staged store promotion/recovery. | [engine-and-reliability.md](engine-and-reliability.md) |
| **Engine leaf split** | `common.py` became a re-export **shim** over an acyclic set of engine leaves (`auth_nav`, `report_nav`, `session`, `site_target`, `routes`, `errors`, `timeouts`, `browser_channels`, `edge_device`); `from common import X` is unchanged. Import direction is guarded (`build/check_import_direction.py`). | [engine-and-reliability.md](engine-and-reliability.md) |
| **GUI restructuring** | `task_coordinator.py` is the single owner of task/gate state (exactly-once terminal delivery); `contract.py` + `ui/contract.js` are the Python⇄JS bridge enum SSOT; endpoint groups split into `gui_endpoint` / `gui_matrix` / `gui_win32`. | [gui.md](gui.md) |
| **Front-end split** | `scripts/ui/` is now `index.html` + `app.css` + `app.js` + `mock.js` (the `#mock` fixtures, a separate file) + `ui-dom.js` and the per-tab renderer modules (`ui-export.js` / `ui-batch.js` / `ui-compare.js` / `ui-matrix.js` / `ui-arcgis.js` / `ui-arcgis-reports.js` / `ui-settings.js`) + `contract.js`. | [gui.md](gui.md) |
| **Comparator substrate** | At the v0.18.0 overhaul the five non-HL vs-TSN file comparators shared `compare_tsn_common` while semantic `compare_core` output stayed byte-identical. Current Phase-1 changes add only shared literal-cell and target-aware write-safety seams; semantic equality remediation remains separately regression-gated. | [comparison-engine.md](comparison-engine.md) |
| **New report (CR-002)** | Intersection Detail (PDF) forward-ported as an exact parallel of Highway Log (PDF) — see the registry tables above. | [reports.md](reports.md) |
| **Packaging / updater** | Updater hardened (fail-closed checksum, staged re-hash before swap, zip-slip guard, bounded retry, revert pagination, log rotation, frozen-only cache clear); a hash-pinned reproducible build; `release.yml` per-variant `.sha256` enforcement; the exact **windowed** exe runs the self-test gate; a credential-safe work-PC **evidence kit** (`evidence.py`, `--collect-evidence`). | [build-and-release.md](build-and-release.md), [work-pc-validation.md](work-pc-validation.md) |

**Two-tier release model:** v0.18.0 is the **offline-validated candidate** (every phase
provable from CI/offline); **v0.18.1** was the **field-validated close-out** of the overhaul.
The full work-PC **operational sign-off** was deferred past it — v0.18.2/3/4 shipped further
field-driven hotfixes — and now cuts as **v0.18.5** (never at v0.18.0).

### v0.18.1 — site-menu-safe selection, report grouping, Highway groundwork

The field close-out tracks the TSMIS site's report-menu migration (flat → grouped fly-outs,
live on dev) **without** breaking the current flat prod menu. Three structural changes; the
detail lives in [reports.md](reports.md) → *Report grouping & site-menu-safe selection*:

- **Selection by stable `data_value`.** `ReportSpec` gained a `data_value` field (the
  option's `data-value` == the hidden `<select>` id); `report_nav._find_exact_option` matches
  it FIRST, falling back to exact text / `data-label`, and `_reveal_submenu_if_leaf` opens the
  nested `cs-submenu` fly-out before the click. **Prod-safe:** an unset/unmatched `data_value`
  behaves exactly as the old text match, so the flat prod menu is unaffected while the nested
  dev menu works. The env-scan probe matches the same way.
- **Catalog-driven picker grouping.** `ExportEntry` gained `group` + `short_label`;
  `report_catalog._PICKER_ORDER` / `picker_order()` fixes the GUI display sequence (flat Highway
  Log / PDF / Sequence, then the Ramp + Intersection families — mirroring the site).
  `reports.PICKER_ORDER` / `EXPORT_DISPLAY` re-export them; `gui_api` sorts the `reports` payload
  by it and sets `idx` = display position (metadata only — the contract keys on stable subdir /
  `cmp:*` keys). Console numbering still follows `EXPORT_REPORTS` order.
- **Highway Detail/Summary (export-enabled v0.19.1).** Two append-only catalog entries at stable
  ids **8 / 9** (`batch_manifest._V017_EXPORT_ORDER` stays `== EXPORT_KEYS`) with real
  `export_highway_*` specs (`save_via_export_button`, dual empty-marker detection) modeled on the
  Excel siblings, clearing the Highway pair from `reports.DISABLED_EXPORT_SUBDIRS` (which
  now holds only the reserved Route History placeholder, v0.25.1). Highway DETAIL's
  consolidate/compare/matrix integration landed in **v0.20.0** (built via the proven
  `build/check_report_recipe.py` recipe, verified against the statewide dev bundle); Highway
  SUMMARY stays export-only until the site un-greys it and a schema can be verified.

`compare_core` and the comparison families are untouched by v0.18.1 — the only comparison change
is a label rename (Intersection Detail's "Roadbed" → "Route Suffix").

## The app today

Current as of **v0.41.0 (2026-08-20)**. The sections above are the historical
record of how the structure was built; this is what the structure now holds.

### Six tabs, one core

| Tab | What it does | Owning docs |
|---|---|---|
| **Export** | Picks report types × routes and drives the shared `ReportSpec` loop. Auto-consolidate, pause/resume, resume-after-crash, fast mode. | [engine-and-reliability.md](engine-and-reliability.md), [reports.md](reports.md) |
| **Consolidate** | Turns a run folder's per-route exports into one workbook, per report; also the entry point for the PDF-sourced consolidations. | [reports.md](reports.md) |
| **Compare** | Every file/folder comparison, in generated sub-tabs: cross-environment, vs TSN, the **vs TSN Matrix** (by day), the **vs Baseline Matrix** (a day against an earlier pull of the same report), and the **PDF vs Excel Matrix** (each dual-edition family self-checked inside one run folder). | [comparison-engine.md](comparison-engine.md) §9, §12b–§12c |
| **Everything** | Two sub-tabs — the always-current batch store (report types × environments into one undated destination, stage-and-swap) and the **Everything comparison matrix** over it. | [comparison-engine.md](comparison-engine.md) §12 |
| **ArcGIS** | Four sub-tabs, none touching the site: **Layers** (v0.46.0 — the `arcgis_layers/` library and its in-app refresh through ArcGIS Pro's own Python, replacing the manual export), **ArcGIS reports** (v0.47.0 — every TSMIS report *rendered* from the layers, ONE build per report, refreshed in place and stamped with the layer drop it came from), **Reports vs ArcGIS** (*Reports vs layers* until v0.47.0 — a by-day MATRIX of every export edition, Excel and PDF, diffed against its report's ArcGIS build) and **Clean Road vs TSN** (our own CA HIGHWAYS table, compared vs the TSN extract). | [comparison-engine.md](comparison-engine.md) §9j–§9l + §12d, [planning/cleanroad-highways.md](planning/cleanroad-highways.md) |
| **Settings** | Site/browser targets, timeouts, TSN datasets, comparison output options (including **Counts only**), the support bundle, updates. | [gui.md](gui.md), [build-and-release.md](build-and-release.md) |

### Three source lanes, deliberately separate

1. **The TSMIS site** — everything the Export tab pulls. One page serves every
   (data source × environment) combination.
2. **The TSN library** (`tsn_library/<report>/raw/`) — manually dropped district
   prints and extracts, normalized once into a versioned canonical library.
   **Frozen**: TSMIS replaced TSN at the 09/2025 cutover, so this lane cannot be
   refreshed and vs-TSN measures migration drift rather than present-day
   agreement.
3. **The ArcGIS layer library** (`arcgis_layers/`) — per-layer exports of the
   TSMIS layers, refreshed in-app with ArcGIS Pro since v0.46.0 (hand-dropped
   before), from which we build our own tables and render reports as-of a chosen
   date. Never touches the site.

### The rule that holds it together

Every one of those surfaces runs on the **same console-free core**. A tab is a
driver: it collects inputs, hands them to an engine function, and renders what
comes back through the `Events` sink and the typed outcome contracts. Nothing in
`scripts/` outside `cli.py` and `gui_*.py` prints, prompts, or exits — which is why
the console flow and the GUI stayed interchangeable across four front-end
generations, and why a new surface costs a driver rather than an engine.
