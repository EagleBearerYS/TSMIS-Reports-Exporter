# Build & Release

What this doc covers: how the portable onefolder bundle is built (`build.ps1` →
PyInstaller `app.spec` → `prune_bundle.ps1`), the three release variants and
their browser channels, the full one-click self-updater (`updater.py`: swap
mode, two-phase install, MOTW-free download, SHA-256 verify, revert), and the
CI/release workflows. This doc OWNS the updater detail and the build pipeline. For
the **code-level updater walkthrough** (the download→stage→two-phase-swap pipeline,
rollback, revert), see [internals/updater-swap.md](internals/updater-swap.md).

## The product is a portable single-folder Windows app

- **Packaging:** PyInstaller **onefolder**, shipped as a portable zip (no
  installer, no Python on the target). Non-technical staff unzip one folder and
  double-click `TSMIS Exporter.exe`.
- **UI stack:** pywebview + **Edge WebView2** rendering vanilla HTML/CSS/JS — no
  frontend framework, no build step, no npm (static files ship in the bundle).
  `webview.start(gui="edgechromium")` is forced so a missing runtime fails loudly
  instead of degrading to MSHTML. `tkinter`/Tcl/Tk are excluded (the UI was a
  Tk window before v0.8.0). WebView2 ships with Windows 10/11 + evergreen Edge.
  Full GUI/threading detail lives in [gui.md](gui.md).
- **Data location (option A):** the packaged app writes `output/`, the auth
  token, logs, and config **next to the `.exe`**, falling back to
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\TSMIS Exporter` if the folder is read-only (`scripts/paths.py`).
  This fallback is what makes an install "read-only" for update purposes (see
  *Read-only installs* below).
- Built/tested on **Python 3.11**. Published exe is not trust-signed yet —
  **code-signing is the only complete fix** for IT/Defender/DLP false-positives.
  A SignPath Foundation cert is applied for; `build.ps1 -Sign` self-signs for
  local/test use and `release.yml` has a gated SignPath step ready
  ([it-and-security.md §7](it-and-security.md)). The trust metadata below is the
  partial mitigation until then.

## `build.ps1` — one-command build

From the repo root:

```
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File build\build.ps1
```

Produces the windowed `dist\TSMIS Exporter\` (~148 MB; double-click
`TSMIS Exporter.exe`). Two switches:

| Switch | Effect |
|---|---|
| `-SelfTest` | After building + pruning, runs the **EXACT shipped windowed exe**'s `--self-test` gate (P10/R1-B04). No longer a separate console exe — the artifact that ships is the artifact that passed (see step 3b). |
| `-RecreateVenv` | Deletes + recreates `build\.venv` for a clean, reproducible install from the lock (P10). |
| `-BundleChromium` | Additionally ships Playwright's own Chromium inside `_internal\ms-playwright` (the with-browser variant). |
| `-Sign` | **Self-signs** the built `.exe` (SHA-256 + timestamp) with a self-signed cert (auto-created in `Cert:\CurrentUser\My`; override `-CertSubject`). Interim/local only — other PCs won't trust it; real signing is SignPath in CI. See [it-and-security.md §7](it-and-security.md). |

Steps:

1. **Isolated, hash-verified build venv** — creates `build\.venv` (`-RecreateVenv`
   deletes + rebuilds it first), then installs the EXACT dependency tree from
   `requirements-build.lock.txt` with `pip install --require-hashes`, and runs
   `build/check_build_env.py` to fail if the resulting environment doesn't match the
   lock (version.py ↔ requirements ↔ lock parity; fail on unexpected/missing/
   mismatched). This makes the build **reproducible** — a polluted env can't produce a
   shipped artifact. (End-user setup uses global pip; only the build uses a venv.)
2. **PyInstaller** — runs `app.spec` with `--distpath dist --workpath build\pyi-work --noconfirm`.
   `TSMIS_ENTRY` is **always** `scripts\gui_main.py` (the exact shipped windowed app) —
   `-SelfTest` no longer builds a separate exe, it runs THIS exe's `--self-test` gate
   afterward. `TSMIS_APP_NAME` = `TSMIS Exporter`; `TSMIS_CONSOLE` = `0` (windowed).
2b. **Optional Chromium bundle** (`-BundleChromium`, done BEFORE the prune so its
   locale trimming applies to the browser too): sets
   `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` at `<AppDir>\_internal\ms-playwright` and runs
   `playwright install chromium --no-shell`. `--no-shell` skips the separate
   headless shell — `channel="chromium"` runs the full browser in new-headless
   mode, so one binary serves headed sign-in AND headless exports.
3. **Prune + DLP guard** — runs `prune_bundle.ps1 -Target <AppDir>` (see below);
   fails the build if DLP-blocked content remains.
3b. **Run the frozen exact-artifact self-test** (only with `-SelfTest`) — runs the
   EXACT shipped windowed `TSMIS Exporter.exe --self-test` over the PRUNED bundle; a
   nonzero exit fails the build. The self-test body lives in `scripts/self_test.py`
   (shared by `gui_main --self-test` and `build/full_smoke.py`); the windowed exe has
   no stdout, so it mirrors a human-readable result to `TSMIS_SELFTEST_OUT`. Building
   proves it *links*; running proves the PRUNED frozen bundle exercises every real code
   path (system browser `page.pdf()` + download, pdfplumber text/table extraction,
   openpyxl round-trip, the matrix modules, GUI construction through the real JS
   bridge). `-SelfTest -BundleChromium` gates the bundled-Chromium path. The artifact
   that ships is the artifact that passed.
   Since 2026-11-12 it also starts a **worker process** (step 5c, `job_host.probe`):
   comparison jobs run in a child process, and a frozen exe hosts one by
   re-launching ITSELF, so only the real artifact can prove that works. The child
   also imports the modules a real job runs (`self_test._WORKER_PROCESS_MODULES`:
   the worker classes and the builders they import on use), so a bundle in which a
   job could only ever fall back to the window's process fails here. This is why
   `gui_main.py` calls `multiprocessing.freeze_support()` as the first statement
   under `__main__` — remove it and every hosted job opens a second window. A child
   that starts and fails fails the gate; an OS that refuses to create the process
   is reported and skipped, because the app keeps those jobs in-process there.
   It also holds the **comparison writer** inside the bundle (step 3b,
   `self_test._writer_probe`): one sheet of the cell shapes a comparison holds is
   written through `compare_core._SheetRows` twice — the direct row path, then
   openpyxl's own with `TSMIS_CLASSIC_XLSX=1` — and every package member must
   match. The line says whether the direct path is **active**; "NOT active" is not
   a failure (the output is the same) but it means this bundle ships without the
   2026-11-12 writer speed-up, which is what an lxml that found its way into the
   bundle would do.
   **If the window step fails**, the message now names why the page never booted:
   the files that did not load, the page's own failure banner, and whether the
   bridge arrived. `watchdog timeout` on a machine with every CPU busy is the
   60-second window watchdog, not a packaging defect (a pristine build does the
   same) — re-run it alone. The refused-connection failure this step used to
   flake on is fixed at its source ([gui.md](gui.md), "Where the time went", 4).
   **After it passes, the self-test's own first-run data is removed** (2026-11-13).
   The test runs the shipped exe from its own folder, which leaves `data\logs`
   (a log carrying the build machine's paths) and the empty `tsn_library\` /
   `arcgis_layers\` skeletons beside it — and the folder is zipped as-is, so
   every release shipped another machine's log and looked like a copy that had
   already been used. `build.ps1` deletes those four folders and fails if anything
   but the exe, `_internal` and the two text files is left.
4. **Report** — copies `dist_readme.txt` in as `Start Here.txt` and
   `it_readme.txt` in as `IT-README.txt` (the IT/security handout), windowed
   builds only, and prints the onefolder size. Both are the first thing a new
   user or a reviewing IT person reads, and `check_shipped_readmes` holds them to
   the code: every label the quick start quotes must still exist in the window,
   its example folder must be a real run-folder name, and the IT notes must name
   the updater's repository, every outbound host and every data folder. (By
   v0.52.1 the quick start still described a four-report app and a browser
   dropdown removed in v0.17.0; nothing had been checking.)

The ~148–149 MB floor is `node.exe` (~80 MB, the Playwright Node driver) +
Python + pythonnet/WebView2 assemblies + pdf/excel libs.

---

## Three release variants, one codebase

| Variant zip | Browser | Approx size | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `*-win64.zip` (default build) | none bundled | ~148 MB | Drives the machine's installed **Edge** (then Chrome). |
| `*-win64-with-browser.zip` (`-BundleChromium`) | Playwright Chromium in `_internal\ms-playwright` | ~246 MB | `paths.py` points `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` there; **Built-in Chromium** is then a selectable export browser (chosen under Settings ▸ Export browser; Edge stays the implicit one-click path). |
| `*-batch-source.zip` (`git archive`) | none | small | The `.bat` console flow; `1. setup…bat` pip-installs the libs **and** runs `playwright install chromium --no-shell`. |

(v0.10.0 published sizes: win64 64 MB / with-browser 246 MB / batch-source — the
64 MB figure predates later bundle growth; current win64 is ~148 MB.)

### Browser channels

`common.launch_browser` probes channels once per process by launching headless
and driving a page, so a too-new Edge falls through to the next channel. Order
(`common.BROWSER_CHANNELS`):

```
chromium (only when present) → chrome → msedge   (Edge LAST, v0.17.0)
```

- `chromium` appears only when a Playwright Chromium is actually present
  (`common._chromium_available()`): the bundle's own `_internal\ms-playwright`,
  an explicit `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH`, or the Settings-tab download
  (`paths.DOWNLOADED_BROWSERS_DIR` = `data\ms-playwright`). The machine's global
  Playwright cache is deliberately ignored so the default build defaults to Edge
  even on a dev PC.
- **Export browser (v0.17.0):** Edge is the **implicit** one-click / device
  sign-in path and the ultimate fallback — no longer a user-pickable export
  browser. The only choice (and only when both exist) is **Built-in Chromium vs
  installed Chrome**, persisted via `settings.get/set_export_browser` and seeded
  into `common.set_preferred_channel` at GUI start (`init_preferred_channel_from_settings`).
  The default is **Chrome when installed** (hence Chrome-before-Edge above). The
  title bar shows a read-only **indicator** of what's exporting; the picker moved
  to **Settings ▸ Export browser**. `set_preferred_channel` accepts only
  `chromium`/`chrome` (anything else, incl. `msedge`, resets to the default order).
- **Override:** `TSMIS_BROWSER_CHANNEL` env var still hard-pins any channel (for
  debugging) and wins over the Settings pick.
- `common.launch_browser` raises `BrowserNotFoundError` only if all channels
  fail (it distinguishes "none installed" from "too new — update the tool").
- **Parallel/fast-mode workers avoid managed Edge:** `_parallel_candidates()`
  orders Built-in Chromium → Chrome → Edge-as-last-resort. See concurrency
  rationale in [engine-and-reliability.md](engine-and-reliability.md).

### `paths.py` browser-path resolution

`PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` is set at import (before any `sync_playwright()`),
and an explicit env value always wins. Two locations probed in order:

1. `BUNDLED_BROWSERS_DIR` = `<exe>\_internal\ms-playwright` (with-browser
   variant; part of the read-only bundle, never user data).
2. `DOWNLOADED_BROWSERS_DIR` = `data\ms-playwright` (Settings-tab download; user
   data, survives one-click updates, deletable in Settings) — used only when
   `_has_chromium()` finds a `chromium-*` folder there.

---

## `app.spec` highlights

Entry = `TSMIS_ENTRY`; output name/console from the other env vars. Key recipe
points:

- **`collect_all('playwright')`** + Playwright's bundled PyInstaller hooks → the
  Node driver (`node.exe`) ships and is importable when frozen. **No browser
  data entry** — no `ms-playwright` is added by the spec (the with-browser
  variant adds it in build.ps1 step 2b).
- **`collect_all('webview'/'pythonnet'/'clr_loader')`** — the GUI shell. Their
  package DATA is load-bearing when frozen: `webview/lib` (WebView2 .NET
  assemblies), `pythonnet/runtime` (`Python.Runtime.dll` + netstandard facades),
  `clr_loader/ffi/dlls` (ClrLoader natives). `hiddenimports += ['clr']`
  (pythonnet's import name).
- **`scripts/ui/*` ships as data files** under `_internal/ui/`; `gui_api`
  resolves them at runtime via `sys._MEIPASS/ui/`.
- **`collect_data_files('pdfminer')`** — the pdfminer CMap data is the classic
  frozen trap (text extraction breaks without it). `collect_all('pdfplumber'/'openpyxl')`.
  `cryptography` is a hard pdfminer import and **must stay**.
- **`APP_MODULES`** lists every flat `scripts/` module as a hidden import (many are
  imported lazily inside functions); **`build/check_app_modules.py` enforces
  completeness** (every flat module declared, no strays, no dups). New
  report/consolidator/comparison modules MUST be added here — v0.18.0 added the
  contract/outcome leaves (`outcome`, `cache_envelope`, `consolidation_meta`,
  `artifact_store`, `contract`, `task_coordinator`), the comparator substrate
  (`compare_tsn_common`), the GUI split (`gui_endpoint`, `gui_matrix`, `gui_win32`),
  `self_test`, `evidence`, `pdf_row_oracle`, `intersection_detail_columns`, the four
  `*intersection_detail_pdf` modules, and the engine leaves (`auth_nav`, `report_nav`,
  `session`, `site_target`, `routes`, `errors`, `timeouts`, `browser_channels`,
  `edge_device`, `export_multi`).
- **`excludes=['tkinter','_tkinter']`** — Tk/Tcl went with the old Tk GUI.
  **Pillow + pypdfium2 SHIP since v0.21.0** (`collect_all` for both + a
  `pypdfium2_raw` hidden import — pdfplumber imports pypdfium2 *lazily* inside
  `to_image`, so static analysis alone can miss it): the visual-evidence
  generator rasterizes PDF pages, draws the highlight boxes, and embeds images
  in the evidence workbook. That reverses the v0.14.x–v0.20.x exclusion
  (~20 MB back), and the frozen `-SelfTest` now proves the render stack
  *works* (a page→PNG→highlight→workbook-embed round-trip in
  `self_test.py` step 4) instead of proving the imports are absent.
- **Trust metadata** (reduces IT/Defender/DLP/SmartScreen false-positives on the
  unsigned exe): version-info resource from `version.py` (`version.py` is the
  single source of truth for the version), `app.ico`, `app.manifest`
  (`asInvoker` + Win10/11 compatibility), and **`upx=False`** (UPX-packed exes
  are a classic AV false-positive trigger). Code-signing remains the only
  complete fix.

## `prune_bundle.ps1` — bundle hygiene + DLP guard

Strips a built bundle to runtime-only files and **fails the build** if
DLP-blocked content remains. Run automatically by `build.ps1` step 3; also
re-runnable on an extracted release:

```
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File build\prune_bundle.ps1 -Target "…\TSMIS Exporter"
```

`-GuardOnly` audits without deleting; `-Quiet` suppresses logging.

**Motivating case:** the Playwright Node driver ships docs/"agent skill" files
(e.g. `driver\package\lib\tools\cli-client\skill\references\tracing.md`) whose
examples contain a test credit-card number like `4111111111111111`. Microsoft
365 / SharePoint DLP detects "Credit Card Number" and **blocks** the file — a
released zip becomes partly inaccessible. Rather than chase one file, the script
strips ALL prose docs.

**Prune set** (verified to keep a real Chromium launch + `page.pdf()` + downloads
working):
- Driver extras: `package\lib\tools\cli-client\skill`, `…\tools\trace`,
  `…\tools\dashboard`, `…\vite`, `package\types`.
- Loose `*.d.ts` anywhere in the driver (driver-scoped); `*.md` is stripped here
  **and** bundle-wide by the later pass (see the all-prose-docs bullet below).
- Chromium locale packs: keep `en-US.pak`, drop the other ~220 locales (~42 MB).
- Render-stack guard (v0.21.0 — the INVERSE of the old excludes safety net):
  **fail the prune** if `_internal\PIL` or `_internal\pypdfium2` is missing, so
  a stale spec can't ship a build whose evidence option dies at first use.
- Generic dead weight: `tests`/`test` dirs and `*.pyi` stubs (skipping the
  `ms-playwright` tree).
- **All prose docs bundle-wide** (`*.md`/`*.markdown`/`*.rst` + stray
  `README`/`CHANGELOG`/`HISTORY`/`AUTHORS`/`CONTRIBUTING`/`NEWS`) **except
  license/notice files** (legally required for OSS redistribution, never
  DLP-flagged). The app's own `Start Here.txt` sits at the app root, not under
  `_internal`, so it is untouched.
- **dist-info/egg-info METADATA sanitized** to its RFC822 headers only (each
  embeds the package's full README as the long-description body; pdfplumber's is
  600+ lines). Drops everything after the first blank line — keeps
  `importlib.metadata.version` working.

**Guards (fail the build with `GUARD FAILED` if found):**
- Any leftover non-license doc (`*.md`/`*.markdown`/`*.rst`).
- **Credit cards** — brand IIN prefix + canonical length + **Luhn** (so random
  16-digit hashes in JS bundles aren't false positives).
- **PEM private keys** — `-----BEGIN … PRIVATE KEY-----`.
- **AWS keys** — `AKIA` + 16 base32.
- **US SSNs** — dashed, with invalid area/group/serial ranges excluded.

The text scan covers the bundled Chromium tree too — a DLP scanner won't exempt
"upstream" files, so neither does the guard. Binaries are skipped by the
text-extension filter.

---

## The one-click self-updater (`scripts/updater.py`)

GUI-only. At launch (quiet unless something is found) and on clicking the
version chip, the app asks the GitHub Releases API for the latest tag and
compares it to `version.__version__`. The only UI is the title-bar pill.
Console/`.bat` flows never update.

`GITHUB_REPO = "EagleBearerYS/TSMIS-Reports-Exporter"` (public repo, stdlib
`urllib`, no token). **It must be the repository's current owner and name.** The
owner account was renamed on 2026-10-12 and the constant kept the old name until
2026-11-13: GitHub redirected it, but a redirect lasts only until someone else
registers the old name — and the checksum the updater verifies is published by
the same release, so the repository path is the update channel's only anchor.
`check_updater` compares the constant with the checkout's `origin` remote.
Copies released before that fix (v0.52.1 and older) still ask the old path.

### TLS — Windows cert store, never certifi

`_http_get` uses `ssl.create_default_context()`, which trusts the **Windows
certificate store** — so corporate TLS inspection roots keep working where a
bundled CA list (certifi) would reject the connection. `urllib` also picks up
the system proxy from the registry. **DO NOT switch this to requests/certifi.**

### `update_support()` — what an install can do

| Verdict | Condition | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `"ok"` | packaged build, app folder writable (`DATA_ROOT == install_dir()`) | full one-click update |
| `"link"` | packaged build in a read-only spot (`paths.py` redirected data to `%LOCALAPPDATA%`) | pill opens the **release page** instead of installing |
| `"off"` | dev / console run (`not is_frozen()`) | update check skipped — no bundle to replace |

### Variant matching

`current_variant()` returns `win64-with-browser` when
`install_dir()\_internal\ms-playwright` exists (same probe `paths.py` uses), else
`win64`. The updater downloads the matching `-<variant>.zip` asset.

### The download → stage → swap pipeline

1. **`check_for_update()`** — hits `/releases/latest` (never returns prereleases
   or drafts), parses `tag_name`, returns an `UpdateInfo` only if newer. HTTP 404
   = repo has no releases yet (returns None, not an error).
2. **`download_and_stage()`** (heavy; runs on a worker thread):
   - Clears `data\update`, checks free disk (needs ~3× the asset size).
   - Streams the zip into `data\update\`, computing SHA-256 as it goes.
     **Writing the bytes ourselves means NO Mark-of-the-Web is ever applied**
     (browsers add the `Zone.Identifier` stream; `zipfile`/raw writes do not), so
     the CLR-blocking MOTW field failure that motivated
     `gui_main._unblock_dotnet_assemblies()` can't happen on this path.
   - **Verifies SHA-256 against the published checksum** (`_expected_sha256`):
     prefers the companion `<asset>.sha256` file (which the release publishes and a
     user can verify by hand), then the GitHub API's own `digest`. A mismatch deletes
     the zip and **refuses to install**. **No published checksum ⇒ FAIL-CLOSED (P10)** —
     the install aborts and shows the release page; there is **no size-only fallback**
     any more. The checksum guards corruption/truncation/wrong-asset, NOT a forged
     release (that is code-signing's job, the planned next step).
   - The download has a socket timeout + **bounded retry**, so a flaky proxy/Wi-Fi link
     doesn't hang or fail on the first hiccup.
   - Extracts to `data\update\extract` with an explicit **zip-slip guard** (every member
     path validated to stay inside the destination before `extractall`), renames the
     inner bundle root to `data\update\staged`, asserts the staged tree has the exe +
     `_internal`, and records a digest over the WHOLE staged tree (`staged.sha256`) for
     the **re-hash before swap** (step 3 re-verifies it before launching the swap exe).
3. **`apply_update_and_restart(staged_dir)`** — launches the **STAGED NEW EXE**
   in swap mode (`SWAP_FLAG = "--apply-update"`, detached, `CREATE_NO_WINDOW`),
   passing the install dir, this app's PID, the helper-log path, and a one-use
   readiness-marker path + nonce. The current app stays open while
   `_wait_for_helper_ready` polls for up to 15 s. The helper publishes the exact
   `ready:<nonce>` only after it has opened a handle to the still-running original
   process. A transient `OSError` reading the atomically replaced marker is retried
   inside that bounded window; persistent unreadability, helper death, a bad marker,
   or a timeout raises `UpdateError`, terminates the unready helper, and leaves the
   old app open. Any marker-access error disables the weaker legacy-log fallback.
4. **`cleanup_leftovers()`** (every GUI launch, before the CLR loads) — removes
   `data\update` staging and stale `*.old`/`*.new` bundle pieces. Deliberately
   removes a staged-but-never-applied download so stale versions are re-offered
   fresh. Also calls `_clear_webview_caches()` (see below).

### Why a swap-mode exe, not a script (work-PC constraint)

v0.9.0 ran a PowerShell helper from `%TEMP%`. On locked-down Caltrans PCs that
block PowerShell entirely for standard users, it was killed silently — the
update downloaded + staged, the app closed, and **nothing was swapped** (the
download just sat in `data\update`). v0.10.1 redesigned it: the staged new exe
applies *itself* via `--apply-update`. The one capability this needs — "exes run
from user-writable folders" — is already proven anywhere the app itself runs. No
PowerShell, cmd, temp scripts, admin, or scheduled tasks. The work PC needs ONE
manual install of ≥ 0.10.1; auto-update works from then on. Full constraint →
[it-and-security.md](it-and-security.md).

### `run_swap_mode` / `perform_swap` — two-phase install

`gui_main` branches into `run_swap_mode(argv)` **FIRST**, before
logging/paths/CLR setup: this process runs from the staged tree under the
install's `data\update\`, so `paths.py`-derived locations would aim at the WRONG
(staged) tree. Everything takes explicit paths and logs by direct appends to
`update_helper.log`.

`perform_swap`:
1. Waits up to `_SWAP_TIMEOUT_S = 120` s for the old app's PID to exit
   (`_wait_pid_exit`, ctypes `OpenProcess`/`WaitForSingleObject` — no psutil in
   the bundle; PID-recycle-safe because the handle is taken while the app is
   still alive).
2. **Phase 1 — COPY** every staged piece to `<name>.new` next to its target
   (this process can't move itself; it runs from `staged`). The big, slow,
   failure-prone work (a ~150 MB copytree under live Defender scanning) happens
   while the installed app is completely untouched — any failure here is a clean
   abort with the old version intact.
3. **Phase 2 — pure RENAMES**: `live → .old`, `.new → live` (instant on the same
   volume). A failure rolls back **with renames too** — never by deleting a
   half-copied tree.

**Why two phases (v0.10.2 field failure):** the old one-phase copy could die
mid-`_internal`, and its delete-based rollback could fail on a Defender-held
file, relaunching a MIXED tree ("says 0.10.2 but features missing").

**Staged allowlist:** the swap installs ONLY the known bundle items
`_BUNDLE_ITEMS = ("TSMIS Exporter.exe", "_internal", "Start Here.txt", "IT-README.txt")` — never
whatever else happens to sit in the staged tree, so a tampered/mis-packaged
extra top-level item can't ride into the install (unexpected items are logged
and ignored). User data (`data\`, `output\`, `input\`) is never in the staged
tree and is never touched.

A rolled-back update **announces itself** when the update is re-offered:
`last_swap_failure()` reads the tail of `update_helper.log` (only the LAST helper
run counts). The swap relaunches the app via `_relaunch()` and a last-resort
`MessageBoxW` on failure (the app is closed by then).

### Revert to the previous version (Settings ▸ Debugging)

`resolve_previous_release()` finds the newest FULL release strictly OLDER than
this build: it lists `/releases` (NOT `/latest`, which never returns older tags),
ignores drafts/prereleases, and picks by **VERSION NUMBER, not GitHub's list
order** (that ordering bug once broke the dev channel). It **variant-skips** a
release missing this variant's zip (a very old release may predate the
with-browser variant) rather than failing with the forward-update message.
Reinstalls through the SAME SHA-verified download → stage → swap pipeline
(`gui_api.revert_to_previous` → `UpdateWorker("revert")`; the pill / restart
dialog read "Reverting…" / "Restart to revert"). Gated to a writable install
(`update_support()=="ok"` — hidden on dev/read-only) and REFUSED while a forward
update is `staged` (it would clobber the staged download). Locked by
`build/check_updater.py` (`test_resolve_previous_release`).

### `_clear_webview_caches()`

Runs in `cleanup_leftovers()` on every **frozen** launch (it sits below the
`is_frozen()` guard — a dev launch serves `scripts/ui` live, so there is nothing to
clear, and clearing it every dev launch was wasted work; moved below the guard in
P10). Drops the WebView2 HTTP caches (`Cache`/`Code Cache`/`GPUCache`/`Service Worker`
under `data\webview2`) but NEVER Local Storage (the theme choice lives there). The
persistent profile could otherwise serve a cached `app.js`/`index.html` after an
update — a just-updated app showing the OLD interface under the NEW version number
(v0.10.2 field report: "says 0.10.2 but features missing"). The caches only ever hold
the app's own UI files, so clearing them on a frozen launch is cheap and kills the
staleness class (manual zip-overwrite installs included).

### `safe_release_url()`

The release page URL comes from the GitHub API's `html_url` — external data over
TLS, but a forged/MITM'd response could put an arbitrary scheme/host there, and
`webbrowser.open()` on a non-https value (`file:`, `javascript:`, a custom
handler) could launch something unexpected. `safe_release_url` returns the URL
only when it is an `https://github.com/<this repo>/…` link, else falls back to
the hardcoded releases page (which lands on the same place since updates only
target the latest release).

### Work-PC evidence kit (`--collect-evidence`, P13)

A GUI-only CLI flag that gathers a **credential-safe** diagnostics zip on a locked-down
work PC (no admin/cmd needed — a desktop shortcut with the flag works). `gui_main.py`
branches to `evidence.collect()` before any heavy init. The bundle is an **allowlist**,
and it is built to be SELF-SUFFICIENT — a maintainer reads it once and knows why the
field PC behaved differently:

| Member | Why it is there |
|---|---|
| `manifest.txt` | provenance, login STATUS, allowlisted settings, the live-verify set, and a listing of every file actually bundled |
| `environment.txt` | the facts no log carries: the **long-path policy** (a managed PC has it off and can't change it — the dev-vs-field difference CMP-AUD-242 turned on), a **path-length census** against the 260-char limit with the longest paths named, free disk, and the data-root length everything else spends from |
| `inventory.txt` | NAME/SIZE/DATE for every file under the data roots, **no content** — a name-shaped failure is invisible in a log and in an artifact, but obvious in a listing (v0.27.0's field bug was a 148-char basename) |
| `state/…` | the JSON sidecars saying what each artifact CLAIMS to be — completion/trust outcomes, provenance (source paths + digests), fingerprints, evidence generation manifests, the per-cell attempt overlay |
| `self_test.txt` | the offline self-test output (a FAILING one is the evidence) |
| `logs/`, `run_reports/` | the rotating diagnostics + per-route saved/empty/failed summaries |
| `user_evidence/` | report/TSN source files placed via `--evidence-dir` (PDF/XLSX/XLS only; a positive allowlist that **refuses** copied cookie stores / login DBs / saved `.html` / any other type) |

It NEVER contains the saved login, the Edge profile, failure dumps, exported report
data, the compressed comparison payloads (they carry compared ROWS — their names and
sizes are in the inventory, their bytes are not), the TSN inputs, or the TSN library
workbooks. The state sweep walks the same folders those artifacts live in, so it
reads both organized `_state/` entries and legacy sibling entries — each under its
REAL relative path, `_state/` included (2026-09-02: collapsing `_state/` into its parent
gave an organized sidecar and its legacy sibling one archive name, and the
duplicate-member guard then refused the whole bundle, so a library carrying both
shapes yielded NO zip at all) — and matches by **exact sidecar suffix/name** — a
data workbook, a source PDF or a payload
chunk cannot match. Packaged via the `evidence` module in `APP_MODULES`; locked by
`build/check_evidence_bundle.py`, whose fixtures plant report ROW DATA beside the
sidecars (not just credentials — the credential scanner would catch those; only the
allowlist keeps report rows out). Full handoff:
[work-pc-validation.md](work-pc-validation.md).

### Two-tier release (v0.18.0 candidate → v0.18.1 close-out → owed operational sign-off)

**v0.18.0 is the offline-validated candidate** — every phase provable from CI/offline
(the exact-artifact self-test, the golden checks). **v0.18.1 was the field-validated
close-out** of the overhaul (it fixed two work-PC field bugs found on v0.18.0). The full
work-PC **operational sign-off** was DEFERRED past v0.18.1; v0.18.2/3/4 then shipped further
field-driven hotfixes, so "enterprise-ready" now cuts as **v0.18.5** (see
[work-pc-validation.md](work-pc-validation.md)). All ship through the same `release.yml` flow.

## Releasing — push a `v*` tag

Bump `version.py` first (v0.18.0 sets it; the tag must be `v<__version__>`); nothing is
published if any gate fails.

> **Version line:** use a PATCH release for field fixes on the current `0.35.x`
> line. Do not open a new minor without asking the owner.

```
git push origin refs/tags/v0.14.2
```

> **GOTCHA — tag/branch name collision:** the working convention names release
> branches the same as the tag (e.g. branch `v0.10.0` + tag `v0.10.0`). A plain
> `git push origin v0.10.0` is ambiguous — push the tag explicitly with
> `git push origin refs/tags/v0.10.0`.

`.github/workflows/release.yml` (on `push: tags: ["v*"]`, or
`workflow_dispatch` with a `tag` input that creates the tag) on
`windows-latest`:

1. **Verify the tag matches `version.py`** — reads `__version__`, asserts
   `TAG == "v<version>"`, fails otherwise ("Bump version.py or fix the tag").
   This is the single-source-of-truth assertion.
2. **Two self-test gates** — `build.ps1 -SelfTest` (system browser) and
   `build.ps1 -SelfTest -BundleChromium` (bundled Chromium). Each builds AND runs
   the frozen smoke test over the pruned bundle; a broken bundle can't ship.
3. **Build + zip three variants** — `build.ps1` then `Compress-Archive` for
   `win64`; `build.ps1 -BundleChromium` then `Compress-Archive` for
   `win64-with-browser`; `git archive` for `batch-source`.
3b. **Code signing (SignPath, gated, inert by default)** — upload the app zip and
   submit it to SignPath, overwriting it with the signed artifact *before*
   checksums so they cover the signed file. Runs only when the repo variable
   `SIGNPATH_ENABLED=true` and `SIGNPATH_API_TOKEN`/`SIGNPATH_ORG_ID` + policy are
   set (post-approval); otherwise skipped. See [it-and-security.md §7](it-and-security.md).
4. **Publish SHA-256 checksums** — one `<asset>.sha256` per zip (sha256sum
   format `"<hash>  <name>"`, ASCII = no BOM, since a BOM would corrupt the
   hash). These are what the updater verifies against. The workflow **FAILS (never
   skips)** if any variant's zip OR its `.sha256` is missing — per-variant artifact
   completeness is a hard gate (P10), so the updater's fail-closed checksum path is
   always the normal path.
5. **Assemble per-version notes** — `gen_release_notes.py "$TAG" -o notes.md`
   joins the shared `build/release_notes_header.md` (download table) with the
   matching `## <tag>` section from `CHANGELOG.md`. Runs *before* the build so a
   missing CHANGELOG section fails fast; each release shows only its own version,
   not the whole history.
6. **Create the GitHub release** with all six assets (3 zips + 3 `.sha256`),
   `--target ${{ github.sha }}`, body from `notes.md`. (Backfill old releases to
   this format with `build/backfill_release_notes.ps1`.)

Uses `actions/checkout@v5` + `actions/setup-python@v6` (the older v4/v5 warned on
the June 16, 2026 GitHub-runner Node-24 switch).

The marketing/landing page is a separate concern on the `gh-pages` branch, with its
own regeneration tooling (`tools/screenshots.py`). Full detail: [website.md](website.md).

## CI: three workflows

CI is **three** workflows, not two:

- **`checks.yml`** — the fast blocking gate below, every push/PR.
- **`release.yml`** — tag-triggered; builds + gates the three variants. Since
  v0.18.5 it FIRST re-runs the whole offline suite in an `offline-checks` job
  (`python build/run_checks.py -j 4`) that the build job `needs:` — a tag on a
  red suite can no longer produce artifacts (the v0.17.3 gate gap).
- **`frozen-gate.yml`** — the slow exact-artifact packaging tripwire: builds the
  real frozen exe for each windowed variant and runs THAT exe's `--self-test`
  over the pruned bundle, plus the source-ZIP console smoke. Heavy, so it runs
  nightly (~07:00 UTC), on `workflow_dispatch`, or when a PR carries the
  `frozen-gate` label — NOT on every push.

The check LIST lives in exactly one place — the `build/check_*.{py,js}` glob:
`build/run_checks.py` runs it locally, and `check_ci_manifest.py` fails the
build if checks.yml ever misses a check on disk (or lists a deleted one).

## CI: `checks.yml` — golden regression gate

`.github/workflows/checks.yml` runs on every push/PR (separate from the release
gate). Blocking steps: byte-compile all sources (`compileall scripts build
version.py`), then the pure-Python golden guards:

- Product-name guard: `check_no_misspelling.py` (fails the build if the product
  name is ever mis-typed — it is always TSMIS)
- Export-engine: `check_export_engine.py`, `check_parallel_reconcile.py`,
  `check_intersection_gate.py`
- GUI bridge + diagnostics: `check_gui_bridge.py`, `check_a2_compare_filter.py`,
  `check_b1_pause.py`, `check_b2_autoconsolidate.py`, `check_b3_batch.py`,
  `check_report_library.py`, `check_matrix.py`, `check_matrix_bridge.py`,
  `check_matrix_tsn.py`, `check_day_matrix.py`, `check_worker_lifecycle.py`
  (per-worker gate-release + queue-advance lifecycle), `check_import_direction.py`
  (no module-level import cycles in `scripts/`)
- Updater: `check_updater.py`
- Fake-site selectors: `check_fake_site.py` (drives a real headless Chromium over
  DOM fixtures; Chromium install is `continue-on-error`, falls back to system
  Edge)
- Comparison engine + consolidators: `check_compare_blankkey`, `_keyfield`,
  `_skipwarn`, `_injection`, `_coercion`, `_limits`, `_audit`, `_ramp_detail`,
  `_ramp_summary`, `_highway_sequence`, `_ramp_detail_tsn`, `_ramp_summary_tsn`,
  `_intersection_summary_tsn`, `_intersection_detail_tsn`, `_highway_sequence_tsn`,
  `check_compare_env_intersection`, `check_compare_env_highway_log_pdf`,
  `check_compare_env_sidelabel` (side-label distinguisher kept under the cap),
  `check_compare_dupmatch`, `_ditto`, `check_ramp_summary_partial`,
  `check_ramp_summary_schema` (Combined-sheet schema-drift guard),
  `check_consolidate_intersection`, `check_tsn_description_leak`,
  `check_tsmis_pdf_parse`, `check_tsmis_pdf_reconcile`,
  `check_highway_log_columns`, `check_highway_log_ditto`,
  `check_highway_log_roadbed`, `check_a1_filenames`

Advisory (never block): `ruff check --select E9,F63,F7,F82`, `bandit -lll -iii`,
`pip-audit`. Full check list + how to run them locally → [verification-and-testing.md](verification-and-testing.md).

> **GOTCHA — cp1252 stdout reds CI:** the regression checks print Unicode (e.g.
> the ` ≠ ` diff marker). The Windows runner's default cp1252 stdout CRASHES on
> it. `checks.yml` sets job-level `PYTHONIOENCODING: utf-8`, AND any golden check
> that prints non-ASCII must `sys.stdout.reconfigure(encoding="utf-8")` itself —
> running locally with `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8` set HIDES the bug (this exact
> failure hit `check_compare_ditto.py` post-v0.14.0, fixed in `a49534f`).

The value/formula comparison flavors are additionally COM-recalc-verified on real
data outside CI (needs Excel) — see [comparison-engine.md](comparison-engine.md)
and [verification-and-testing.md](verification-and-testing.md).
