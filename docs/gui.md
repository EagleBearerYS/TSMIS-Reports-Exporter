# GUI: pywebview / WebView2 desktop shell

What this doc covers: the desktop GUI's UI stack, the Python⇄JS bridge and threading/queue model, the WebView2 profile and data-location decisions, the five hard-won pywebview field traps (this doc OWNS them), and how to live-verify `scripts/ui/` changes.

For the engine the GUI drives, see [engine-and-reliability.md](engine-and-reliability.md); for sign-in flows surfaced in the GUI, [auth-and-signin.md](auth-and-signin.md); for the updater swap-mode/MOTW/SHA-256 pipeline (full treatment), [build-and-release.md](build-and-release.md) and [it-and-security.md](it-and-security.md); for golden checks + verification loops, [verification-and-testing.md](verification-and-testing.md); cross-cutting field-failure narratives live in [lessons.md](lessons.md).

> **Code-level walkthrough:** [internals/gui-bridge.md](internals/gui-bridge.md) — the full Python⇄JS message lifecycle (kind→handler→event→renderer), the single-task gate, every worker's `run()`, and the env-scan concurrency.

## UI stack

The packaged product is a **pywebview window using the Edge WebView2 backend**, rendering `scripts/ui/` — **plain HTML/CSS/JS, no framework and no build step**. As of v0.18.0 the front-end is split into `index.html` + `app.css` + `app.js` (orchestration) + `mock.js` (the `#mock` fixtures, a SEPARATE file — never edit fixtures in `app.js`) + `ui-dom.js` and the per-tab renderer modules (`ui-export.js` / `ui-batch.js` / `ui-compare.js` / `ui-matrix.js` / `ui-arcgis.js` / `ui-arcgis-reports.js` / `ui-settings.js`) + `contract.js` (the bridge enum mirror of `scripts/contract.py`). Static files ship in the bundle; end-user setup stays global-pip. This replaced the original Tkinter window (v0.8.0): Tk could neither match the approved design (Windows-11 look, dark titlebar, two-column layout) nor stop cutting off on small screens. A web layout is responsive (stacks + scrolls below ~980px wide; theme = System/Light/Dark header toggle persisted in `localStorage`, resolved to an effective `html[data-theme]` before first paint).

WebView2 is a safe dependency here: it ships with Windows 10/11 and evergreen Edge — the same Edge this tool already requires. `tkinter`/`_tkinter` are **excluded** from the bundle.

### Design tokens — colour, radius, motion, and TYPE

`app.css` opens with the token block. Colour and radius have been tokenised for a
long time (62 custom properties; only two hardcoded hex values in the whole
sheet). **Type joined them after an audit found 13 distinct font sizes across 101
declarations, six of them half-pixels** (9.5 / 10.5 / 11.5 / 12.5 / 13.5). The
six-step scale is `--text-2xs` 10 · `--text-xs` 11 · `--text-sm` 12 ·
`--text-base` 13 · `--text-lg` 15 · `--text-xl` 17, and
`build/check_type_scale.py` fails on a raw px font-size or a non-integer token.

Two things worth knowing before touching it:

- **Whole pixels are the point, not tidiness.** A 1366×768 work PC runs at 150%
  DPI, where a `.5px` size lands between device pixels and Windows rounds it
  inconsistently from one element to the next — which is what made the UI read as
  slightly unfinished on exactly the machines this ships to.
- **The half-pixels were never a finer scale.** Each sat in the same role as its
  integer neighbour (12.5px on tabs and chips, right beside 12px on tabs and
  chips), so each pair collapsed onto one token. `base` is 13px because that is
  what `body` has always been.

**Spacing is deliberately NOT tokenised**, and that is a measured decision rather
than an omission: 48 of the 59 padding/margin/gap declarations already sit on a
2px rhythm. The nine that do not (1 · 3 · 5 · 7 · 9 px) are each a density choice
on a hand-tuned element — `.option-row` at 9px vertical is the height of all 98
option rows; `.route-cell` at 5px is the density of the route grid — and the
layout is built around real constraints (a 1366×768 laptop at 150% DPI is ~910
CSS px, which the stylesheet's own comments design for). Rounding them onto a
grid is a visual decision for the owner, not a cleanup to apply blind.

**`webview.start(gui="edgechromium")` is forced** so a missing runtime fails loudly with a clear message box (`_fatal_box`, "The app window could not be created.") instead of silently degrading to the legacy MSHTML backend. Verified in `gui_api.run()`:

```python
webview.start(gui="edgechromium", debug=debug,
              private_mode=False, storage_path=str(WEBVIEW_PROFILE_DIR))
```

The GUI is owned by a small set of Python modules (v0.18.0 split the old monolith out by concern); the engines underneath stay console-free:

| Module | Role |
|---|---|
| `scripts/gui_main.py` | Entry point. `_bootstrap()` dev import paths; swap-mode branch; the `--self-test` / `--collect-evidence` CLI branches; `_unblock_dotnet_assemblies()`; `setup_logging(enable_faulthandler=False)`; `updater.cleanup_leftovers()`; then `gui_api.run()`. |
| `scripts/gui_api.py` | The `GuiApi` js_api bridge + the worker-queue pump + `run()` (creates the window, starts the webview loop). Mixes in `gui_matrix.GuiMatrixMixin`; delegates task/gate state to `task_coordinator`. |
| `scripts/task_coordinator.py` | **The single owner of task/gate state** (P7a). A monotonic claim **epoch** stamps every worker message so a straggler terminal from a superseded task can't clobber an already-started successor (exactly-once terminal delivery). |
| `scripts/contract.py` + `scripts/ui/contract.js` | The Python⇄JS **bridge enum SSOT** — message kinds, completion states, etc. — so the two sides can't drift. |
| `scripts/gui_endpoint.py` / `gui_matrix.py` / `gui_win32.py` | Extracted endpoint groups (P7b/P7c): the endpoint base, the Matrix feature endpoints (the mixin), and the pywebview/win32 window concerns. |
| `scripts/gui_worker.py` | The worker threads — `ExportWorker`, `LoginWorker`, `CheckWorker`, `ConsolidateWorker`, `BatchWorker`, `EnvCheckWorker`, `ActiveEnvCheckWorker`, `EnvScanWorker`, `ChromiumWorker`, `ResetWorker`, `UpdateWorker`, plus the matrix workers `MatrixBatchExportWorker` / `MatrixCompareWorker` / `DayMatrixCompareWorker` / `MatrixTsnConsolidateWorker`. **Not** force-split. |

Only `cli.py` and `gui_*.py` touch `print`/`input`/`msvcrt`/the window. Core code (`common.py`, `exporter.py`, the consolidator cores) reports via the `Events` sink (`scripts/events.py`) and raises exceptions — never `print`/`input`/`sys.exit`.

## UI-demo: visual source of truth

`C:\Users\Yunus\Projects\tsmis-exporter-ui-demo` is a Lovable-built React/TanStack/Tailwind demo the user "really liked the look of". Its OKLCH design tokens, dark-titlebar layout, and component styling were ported into `scripts/ui/app.css` during the v0.8.0 rewrite (June 2026). It is **feature-stale** (models v0.4.x — no fast mode, dated outputs, device sign-in, or site pickers): treat it as the **visual** source of truth / design inspiration only, NEVER as a feature spec.

## Threading and the queue model

Playwright's sync API is **thread-affine** — only the thread that created a page may touch it. So all browser work runs on worker threads. The message flow:

1. **Workers → GUI:** each worker thread posts `(kind, payload)` tuples onto `GuiApi._q` (a `queue.Queue`). The full per-message protocol is documented at the top of `gui_worker.py`, and `gui_api._handle` is the exhaustive dispatcher. The handled kinds are `log`, `progress`, `worker_status`, `preview_shot`, `env_shot`, `env_access`, `env_access_done`, `reset_done`, `chromium_done`, `export_done`, `export_partial`, `consolidate_done`, `login_open`, `login_saved`, `login_device_ok`, `login_failed`, `cancelled`, `batch_progress`, `batch_done`, `update_status`, `check`, `checks_done`, `matrix_cell`, `matrix_done`, `matrix_export_done`, `active_env_done`, `error` (the kind strings + the completion vocab now live ONCE in `scripts/contract.py` / `ui/contract.js`, so Python and JS can't drift; `run_ended` / the export summary additionally carry the `completion` + `artifact` outcome fields).
2. **The pump:** `GuiApi._worker_pump` (thread `gui-pump`) drains `_q` and dispatches each message through `_handle(kind, payload)` — the state machine that mutates GUI state and enqueues JS events. (This is the WebView reimplementation of the old Tk `gui_app._handle`.)
3. **GUI → JS, single ordered path:** `_handle`/api methods enqueue events onto a SECOND queue `_out`. **One** sender thread (`gui-send`, `GuiApi._sender`) drains `_out`, batches up to **200** events, and delivers them as one JSON array via `evaluate_js("window.__tsmis && window.__tsmis.dispatch(...)")`. Because everything to JS goes through this one ordered queue, log lines, progress, and state snapshots can never interleave out of order. `json.dumps(batch, default=str)` so a future non-JSON payload degrades to a string instead of killing the whole batch.
4. **JS → Python:** `app.js` calls back through `window.pywebview.api.<method>()` (the public `GuiApi` methods), each returning a Promise.

State mutations take `self._lock` (an `RLock`). In fast mode each export worker owns its own Playwright/browser/context. Two `threading.Event`s gate the loop (`cancel_event`, `skip_event`) plus `pause_event` (B1 between-route hold); login uses `login_done`/`login_cancel`.

### Sequence (one event batch)

```
worker thread ── (kind,payload) ──▶ _q ──▶ _worker_pump/_handle ──▶ _out
                                                                       │
                                              _sender (one thread, batch ≤200)
                                                                       │
                                    evaluate_js → window.__tsmis.dispatch([…])
                                                                       │
app.js dispatch() routes each ev.t (state|log|progress|run_started|run_ended|
                                     wstatus|preview|modal|…) to a renderer
                                                                       │
JS user action ── window.pywebview.api.<method>() ──▶ GuiApi (Promise reply)
```

### What a batch costs — the two coalescing rules

A batch is drained from the queue, not metered, so it routinely carries SEVERAL
full state snapshots — there are ~92 `_push_state()` call sites, 54 of them in
`gui_matrix.py` alone. Two rules keep a burst cheap, and both are locked by
`build/check_state_paint_coalescing.js`:

- **`dispatch` assigns every state but paints only the last.** `S.st = ev.s` runs
  for each one in order (so anything an interleaved handler reads is unchanged);
  `paintState()` runs only at the final state index. Each state is a FULL
  snapshot, so the last paint produces the same DOM the whole sequence would
  have. Measured on the matrix tab: a 20-state batch went **194 ms → 21 ms**.
  The `_lastTask` TSN-rebuild watcher deliberately stays OUTSIDE that guard — it
  watches for a task *transition*, so collapsing the states could step over the
  consolidate→idle edge.
- **`paintState` repaints only the matrix on screen.** All four updaters used to
  run on every push regardless of tab. Arriving at any matrix tab runs its own
  full render (`setTab` / `setEverySub`), so an off-screen matrix loses nothing.

The third piece is `applyLockState`: the ~324 `disabled` writes and eight
container sweeps that greyed the UI on every push now run only when `locked`
actually CHANGES, and the 98 option rows grey from a single **`body.busy`** class
in CSS instead of a per-row class write. That is safe only while every locking
control either exists before the first render or sets its own `disabled` when
built — a new dynamic control must do one or the other. Together these took
`renderState` from 22 `querySelectorAll` sweeps / 324 element writes to **5 / 58**.

> **Measure before "optimizing" an animation here.** Three layout-animating CSS
> rules look like obvious jank (`transition: flex-grow` on the two columns,
> `transition: width` on the progress fill, `@keyframes indeterminate` animating
> `left` forever). Profiled on the matrix tab against a forced-layout control
> they cost **0.05–0.13 ms per frame** — 1.9 ms for the whole 240 ms column
> transition, and ~194 ms per MINUTE for the indeterminate bar, i.e. under 0.4%
> of a frame. They are in isolated layout scopes, so the textbook concern does
> not apply. Left alone deliberately; see [lessons.md](lessons.md) #16.

## UI layering: Python owns state, JS owns presentation

**Python owns all app state** (auth, task, checks, days, batch, update, env-access) and pushes **full snapshots** (`_state_snapshot()` → `{t:"state", s:…}`, sent on every `_push_state()`). `app.js` owns ONLY presentation + form fields and **never invents log lines** — everything shown in the log pane originates in Python so the `tsmis.ui` file-log mirror stays complete. The mirror: `_emit_log(text)` logs the line to the `tsmis.ui` logger AND emits it to JS; `_emit_modal` and `ui_event` likewise log every dialog and user UI event. So `tsmis.log` carries the user's view of a run (what was clicked, what was reported) next to the engine's own diagnostics — the "one log upload answers it" contract.

Every `GuiApi` public method is wrapped by `_api_method`: an uncaught exception in a windowed `.exe` would vanish (no stderr) and leave the UI hanging on a dead Promise, so it logs the full traceback to `tsmis.crash` and returns a structured `{"error": …}` to JS instead. Uncaught JS errors come back through `api.log_js_error` → `tsmis.crash`.

## Persistent WebView2 profile

The GUI window uses a persistent **app-owned** user-data folder, `paths.WEBVIEW_PROFILE_DIR` (`data\webview2`), via `webview.start(private_mode=False, storage_path=…)`. pywebview's default private mode writes a **fresh Chromium profile into `%TEMP%` on EVERY launch** (tens of MB, leaked when the process is killed) and cold-starts the browser each time. One stable folder avoids both, and the UI stores nothing sensitive in it. (`updater._clear_webview_caches()` drops the WebView2 HTTP caches on every **frozen** launch — it sits below the `is_frozen()` guard in `cleanup_leftovers`, since a dev launch serves `scripts/ui` live — so an update's new `app.js` is never served stale; Local Storage/theme are untouched.)

## Data location (option A)

The WebView2 profile (above) lives under the app's data tree. The packaged app writes ALL its data — `output/`, the auth token, logs, config, and that profile — **next to the `.exe`**, with a `%LOCALAPPDATA%\TSMIS Exporter` fallback when the folder is read-only (which also flips the updater into link-only mode). The full data-location model (`DATA_ROOT`/`OUTPUT_ROOT`/derived paths) is owned by [architecture.md](architecture.md); the IT/file-by-file view is in [it-and-security.md](it-and-security.md).

## Accessibility posture (measured 2026-08-21)

This is a Caltrans tool, so Section 508 / WCAG 2.1 AA is a question that gets
asked. These are **measurements against the running UI**, not intentions — every
figure below was taken in the `#mock` across the Export, Compare, Everything ▸
matrix and Settings tabs, in both themes.

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Text contrast vs WCAG AA (4.5:1 body, 3:1 large) | **0 failures**, light and dark |
| Accessible names on checkboxes + radios | **117 / 117** — every one via a wrapping `<label>` |
| Accessible names on buttons | **360 / 360** |
| Focus indication | 18 `:focus-visible` rules; **0 of 200** sampled focusables lacked a matching focus rule |
| `prefers-reduced-motion` | Global block neutralises `*, *::before, *::after`, plus a specific re-override for the `!important` theme cross-fade |
| Positive `tabindex` (breaks natural order) | **0** |
| Keyboard traps in hidden panes | **0 of 523** focusables in `display:none` subtrees are Tab-reachable |
| Tab semantics | 4 tablists, each with exactly one `aria-selected="true"` |
| Document `lang` / `title` | `en` / "TSMIS Exporter" |
| Horizontal overflow at 910×512 (a 1366×768 work PC at 150% DPI) | **0 px** on all six tabs |
| Pathological content (a 180-char OneDrive path + a 4× repeated error line, injected into six path/label surfaces) | **0 px** page overflow, **0** elements burst their container |

**Not verified, and not claimed:**

- **Real screen-reader behaviour.** Accessible names exist and the roles are
  right, but nobody has driven this with NVDA or JAWS. Names being present is
  necessary, not sufficient — announcement order and live-region behaviour during
  a run are unmeasured.
- **Keyboard traversal by hand.** The absence of positive `tabindex` and of
  reachable focusables in hidden panes rules out the common traps; actually
  tabbing the whole app has not been done.
- **Non-text contrast** (borders, icon glyphs, focus rings against their
  backgrounds) — the audit measured text only, which is the 1.4.3 criterion.
  1.4.11 non-text contrast is untested.

Two traps worth knowing before you re-run any of this:

- **The `#mock` preview does not composite frames when the pane is hidden**, so
  width and computed flex values there are unreliable — it reported `flex-grow: 0`
  and 2px columns at 1280px while the same page measured correctly at 800px. Use
  height / `scrollHeight`, computed colour, and element counts, which are stable;
  do not conclude a layout bug from a width read alone.
- **Crude probes lie in both directions here.** `read_page` renders the option
  checkboxes as `checkbox "on"`, which looks exactly like a missing label and is
  not — they are wrapped in `<label>`. Splitting the stylesheet on the first
  `prefers-reduced-motion` finds the small matrix-only block and misses the global
  one below it. Check the DOM or the source before believing either.

## The FIVE pywebview traps (all hit in the field)

These are the load-bearing constraints. Each one cost a real field failure; do not regress them.

### Trap 1 — never rename the main thread; `[main]` is a logging Filter

pywebview detects "is `start()` already running" via the **main thread's NAME**. `logging_setup` must therefore never rename the main thread — it tags `[main]` via a logging `Filter` (`_MainThreadTag`, which rewrites `record.threadName` from `"MainThread"` to `"main"` in the LOG RECORD only) instead of `threading.main_thread().name = …`. Renaming the actual thread makes pywebview's `create_window` treat it as "the GUI loop is already running" and **block forever** running the GUI loop itself. Verified in `logging_setup.setup_logging`.

### Trap 2 — never do work in window-event handlers; set the icon from a worker

pywebview fires window events (`shown`, etc.) on the **WinForms STA thread while WebView2 is still initializing asynchronously on it**. A handler that blocks (the original icon-setter loaded a .NET assembly) starves the message pump and **INTERMITTENTLY deadlocks the window** — "Not responding" + WER `AppHangB1` before the page loads (~6/8 launches at its worst, machine-state dependent). The fix: only `closed` (which fires after the loop ends) is subscribed (`window.events.closed += self._on_closed`); the icon is set from a **plain worker thread** with pure Win32 (`_set_window_icon_late`: `_find_own_window`/`EnumWindows` matched on our own PID → `LoadImageW` + `SendMessageW`/`WM_SETICON`). The taskbar-flash notification (`_flash_taskbar`, `FlashWindowEx`, v0.13.0) follows the SAME off-STA, never-in-a-window-event-handler approach — though it runs **inline on the `gui-pump` thread** rather than spawning its own (the icon setter uses a dedicated `gui-icon` thread). The load-bearing rule is the same: neither runs in a pywebview window-event handler.

### Trap 3 — `faulthandler` is disabled in the GUI process

`gui_main.main()` calls `setup_logging(enable_faulthandler=False)`. `faulthandler`'s Windows handler sees the CLR's **routine first-chance access violations** (pythonnet, which the WebView2 backend runs on) and dumps all threads mid-exception-dispatch — observed wedging init ("Not responding", WER `AppHangB1`) and spamming `crash.log` with dumps from healthy-looking runs. Console entry points never load the CLR and keep faulthandler's hard-crash dumps. Python-level crashes in the GUI are still caught by `sys.excepthook` + `threading.excepthook` and the `_api_method` wrapper. Verified in `logging_setup.setup_logging`'s docstring and code.

### Trap 4 — Mark-of-the-Web kills the CLR; `_unblock_dotnet_assemblies()`

Extracting a release zip **without Unblock** tags every file with an NTFS `Zone.Identifier` stream, and .NET Framework **refuses to load tagged assemblies** → instant "Failed to resolve Python.Runtime.Loader.Initialize" (field failure, v0.8.0's first download). Dev runs and CI never go through a downloaded zip, so ONLY releases hit it. `gui_main._unblock_dotnet_assemblies()` strips the `Zone.Identifier` streams from the bundled `.NET` trees (`_internal/pythonnet`, `_internal/clr_loader`, `_internal/webview`) **at startup, before the CLR loads** (called right after `setup_logging`, before `cleanup_leftovers`/`import gui_api`). Only the CLR cares — plain Win32 DLL loads ignore the tag — so only those trees are cleaned. Best-effort: on a read-only install it fails and the fatal box explains the manual Unblock. Repro for testing: `Set-Content <dll> -Stream Zone.Identifier` with `ZoneId=3` on `_internal\pythonnet\**`. Full IT/Defender view in [it-and-security.md](it-and-security.md); the in-app-download path never carries MOTW (zipfile writes raw bytes) — see [build-and-release.md](build-and-release.md).

### Trap 5 — the js_api OBJECT appears before its method stubs

On a cold WebView2, `window.pywebview.api` can **exist while pywebview is still injecting the method functions into it** — calling one throws "`get_initial_state` is not a function" and a one-shot boot died on it permanently (field failure, first launch after the v0.10.2 update — the coldest start there is, Windows still scanning every fresh file). Two-layer defense in `app.js`:

- **`bridgeReady()` gates boot on the METHOD, not the object:** `!!(window.pywebview && window.pywebview.api && typeof window.pywebview.api.get_initial_state === "function")`. The `pywebviewready` event handler boots only `if (bridgeReady())`; a 150 ms `setInterval` poll catches a ready event that fired before the listener attached.
- **`boot()` retries `get_initial_state` ~6 times**, re-grabbing `window.pywebview.api` each round (stubs may have landed), with backoff `Math.min(1000*attempt, 3000)`.

A reassuring "Still starting…" banner appears at **8 s** (the poll keeps running; a late bridge still boots); the real failure banner (`showFatal`, "The app's interface couldn't connect to its engine") only at **60 s**.

## The `#mock` API (opt-in only; must never auto-start)

`app.js` ships a built-in mock API that can drive the whole UI — simulated runs included — without launching the real app. It is engaged ONLY when the URL carries a `mock` flag: `const WANT_MOCK = /[?#&]mock\b/.test(location.search + location.hash)`. That's how the layout is screenshot-tested (open `scripts/ui/index.html#mock` in a browser).

**The mock must never auto-start.** A cold WebView2 can inject the real bridge later than any fixed timeout, and a silent mock fallback would show convincing **fake exports inside the real app**. So without `#mock`, the page only ever waits for the real bridge (the poll above) and shows the fatal banner if it never arrives — it never falls back to the mock. The mock factory is `makeMockApi()`; `boot(makeMockApi())` runs only inside `if (WANT_MOCK)`.

## Verifying UI changes (live, via the preview mock)

How to live-verify `scripts/ui/` changes without launching the packaged app, and the gotchas that waste time (from the preview-verification memory):

- **Mock server:** from the repository root, run
  `python -m http.server 8765 --bind 127.0.0.1 --directory scripts/ui`, then open
  `http://127.0.0.1:8765/index.html#mock` in an available browser. Use the project's
  Python interpreter if `python` does not resolve to it. The `#mock` hash enables
  the built-in mock API; without it the page waits for the real pywebview bridge.
  Keep mock mode explicit so the packaged app cannot silently display fake exports.
  An editor's local preview launcher is optional.
- **Bare `S`, not `window.S`:** app state is `const S` at module scope, which does NOT attach to `window`. In a browser-console evaluation, reference **`S.st` / `S.init`** directly — `window.S` is always `undefined` (false-negative "not booted").
- **If screenshots stall:** inspect DOM state, classes, computed styles, and
  geometry with the browser's available inspection tools. Record which visual
  checks could not be completed; a screenshot-tool failure is not an app failure.
- **Cache / stale page:** the browser HTTP-caches `app.js` **and `app.css`** (and the other `ui-*.js` modules). A page-URL `?v=` cache-bust does NOT refresh them, and a preview-server restart alone does not either (the browser reuses the cached files across restarts). **Reliable fresh assets** after editing: in a browser-console evaluation run `await fetch('http://localhost:8765/app.js',{cache:'reload'}); await fetch('http://localhost:8765/app.css',{cache:'reload'});` (add any edited `ui-*.js` the same way) then `location.reload()` and re-navigate to `#mock`. Confirm fresh code loaded with `typeof <a-newly-added-fn> !== 'undefined'`. `Date.now()`/`Math.random()` are fine in a browser-console evaluation (they execute in the inspected page).
- **Async confirms:** clicking `#btnStartExport` shows the "No saved login" confirm asynchronously — click Start, then in a SEPARATE eval click the "Start anyway" button, then check `S.st.task`. A single combined eval finds no modal yet.
- **Mock event ORDER ≠ production (v0.18.4 lesson):** on a job finish the **mock** emits `state` THEN `run_ended`+`matrix_refresh` (mock.js), but the **real bridge** emits `run_ended` (→ async `renderMatrix`/`renderDayMatrix`) THEN `state` THEN `matrix_refresh` (`_end_task` then `_on_matrix_done`). So an ORDER-sensitive bug won't show by driving the mock's own flow — replay the production order directly: `dispatch([{t:'run_ended'},{t:'state',s:{...S.st,matrix_current:null,task:null}},{t:'matrix_refresh'}])`. This is how the **matrix queue-phantom** (a finished/cancelled compare stuck "running" in the queue panel, both matrices) was caught. Root cause: `.mc-group{display:flex}` (app.css) outranks the UA `[hidden]{display:none}`, so `el.hidden=true` did NOT hide the panel — fixed with `.mc-group[hidden]{display:none}` + clearing the row list on every `renderQueuePanel` path. **Watch for the same trap on any element you hide via `el.hidden` that also has a class-level `display` rule.**

Golden checks (no login, fast) live under `build\.venv\Scripts\python.exe build\check_*.py` — `check_gui_bridge.py` exercises `gui_api` (its "dialog blew up" traceback is an intentional test, still `[OK]`). Run them after Python edits. Full list + the COM-recalc compare loop: [verification-and-testing.md](verification-and-testing.md).

## The comparison matrix (Everything ▸ Comparison-matrix sub-tab)

The Everything pane has **two sub-tabs** (`.subtabs` like Compare's): *Refresh & export*
(`#everyExport`, the batch controls) and *Comparison matrix* (`#everyMatrix`). A single
**`app.js applyMatrixWide()`** computes the full-width context from `S.tab`/`S.everySub`/
`S.compareGroup` and toggles `body.matrix-wide` (+ `body.mw-day` for the by-day matrix,
`body.mw-bl` for the vs-Baseline matrix — each picks its own config corner);
`setEverySub`, `setTab`, and `selectCompareGroup` all call it, so every entry point stays
in sync and leaving always clears it. **Full-width layout:** `.main` is a flex row (not
grid) so the two columns' `flex-grow` can animate — `body.matrix-wide` grows the config
column and shrinks the activity column to a slim, still-present log (the
preflight/completion cards step aside; the grid fills width *and* height with the
data rows sharing the leftover height). NB grid-template-columns can't transition
between `minmax(…fr)` track-lists in Chromium, which is why the layout is flex.
**Both matrices share the same full-width CSS** via three classes — `.mx-host` (the
pane), `.mx-pane` (the matrix container), `.mx-gridsection` (the grid's card-section) —
so the rules are written once (`body.matrix-wide .mx-pane …`) and the Everything matrix
and the by-day matrix get identical layout.

The grid (`renderMatrix`) is fed by `gui_api.matrix_info` (a pure-filesystem
snapshot). **7 rows** (every report — Ramp Summary/Detail, Highway Sequence, both
Highway Log formats, Intersection Summary/Detail — all with cross-env AND vs-TSN as of
v0.17.0); each **row header** carries the
report name (evidence-supported rows append a small **camera badge**, v0.24.0 —
`evidenceRowBadge`: only the PDF-edition rows carry one since the 2026-08-05
ruling — four at first, FIVE since v0.37.0 when Highway Detail (PDF) joined on the
pre-release freeze lifting (vs-TSN only; it has no env hooks, so the env lane stays
at four); every other row gets no
badge, the toggle's status lines name them), a per-row **comparison-mode select**
(compact + content-sized in a
`.mx-fluent-select` chevron wrapper; the "(soon)" greying is now defensive — every
mode is coded), a vs-TSN
**file picker** when in a TSN mode — a **status-dot chip** (`.mxtp-file`) that surfaces
the active TSN file (green dot = file ready / amber = dropped PDFs need consolidating /
grey = none) over compact Choose / Consolidate / Clear buttons — and a **per-row
refresh**; each **column header** has a **per-column refresh**. Refreshes are polished
**ghost icon-buttons** (`.mxch-refresh`) and the header **baseline picker** is a
light-surface `select-light` (not the dark title-bar skin). Each cell renders the unified `cmp` state — **discrepancy count,
colour-coded** (`.mx-match`/`.mx-diff-lo`/`.mx-diff-hi`/`.mx-stale`/`.mx-missing`/`.mx-na`)
plus greyed / needs-export / needs-TSN / "consolidate N PDFs" / stale states — with
compact **icon** actions (`↻ export` / `↻ compare` / `↗ open`, gated on support+built; since
v0.23.0 a **camera** on built, FRESH cells — the on-demand evidence run for the existing
comparison, offered ONLY on the tsn/env modes of the PDF-edition rows since the
2026-08-05 ruling — five rows on the tsn mode as of v0.37.0 (Highway Detail (PDF)
joined), four on env; a missing TSN print set reports per cell at run time).
The **config zone** (`#matrixConfig`, a card under the slim activity log, shown via
`body.matrix-wide:not(.mw-day)`) holds the report + **environment-column** show/hide toggles,
the global "set all comparisons to…" (env|tsn), the live-formulas toggle, the **evidence-images
toggle + per-column count** (`#matrixEvidence` / `#matrixEvidenceCount` — ONE shared persisted
pair `evidence_images`/`evidence_examples` mirrored on the by-day corner, synced by
`syncMatrixEvidence` off the state's `evidence` block; greyed only when NO report is ready.
Since v0.24.0 the hint is an always-visible **status block** (`.ev-status-line`); the
2026-08-05 amendment re-truthed it to the print-crop rule: one ✓/○ line PER supported
PDF-edition family (✓ with its TSN print count when the prints are dropped, ○ naming
the drop folder when not), one ✓ line for the four cross-environment PDF-vs-PDF cells
(both environments' own prints), and one "No evidence: …" line naming every other row
(the state's `evidence.unsupported`, one entry per row, derived server-side from
`matrix_rows()` × `visual_evidence.capable`/`env_capable` — evidence exists only for
the PDF-edition families, so an Excel row is listed even when its PDF sibling is
supported) — so the toggle is never a mystery switch —
[comparison-engine.md](comparison-engine.md) §13), the live
queue, and the **fast-mode browser-count spinner** (`#matrixWorkers`, the `.mc-workers` row): it writes the
shared `fast_workers` setting via `set_setting`, so the matrix corner, the Export pane
(`#fastWorkers`) and the Settings tab (`#setFastWorkers`) stay on one value; `syncMatrixFast`
reflects it (and greys the row when fast mode is off). A baseline `<select>` (switch → confirm →
`set_matrix_baseline` + `recompute_matrix("all")`), Refresh-stale (also the **resume**
after a **Cancel**), Open-comparisons-folder, and a Cancel button live in the actions
row. `updateMatrixProgress()` greys all matrix controls live + toggles the Cancel
button; the grid re-renders on `run_ended` / `matrix_refresh`. The mock returns the
full multi-mode snapshot (modes, row_modes, all_envs, hidden_envs, tsn_meta) + every
new bridge method, exercising all states at `/index.html#mock`. Engine + bridge:
[comparison-engine.md](comparison-engine.md) §12. **Headless caveat:** the `#mock`
reports viewport width 0 until `preview_resize`d and won't tick transitions — verify
the wide layout end-state via DOM measurement.

### The matrix job queue + fast mode + row/col buttons (v0.16.0)

Matrix actions no longer claim the single-task gate directly — they **enqueue a
Job** and the queue runs one at a time. The queue lives in `gui_api`: `self._queue`
(deque) + `self._current_job` + `self._job_seq`; `_enqueue_matrix_job` →
`_try_start_next_matrix_job` (claims the gate AND `popleft`s **atomically** under the
lock, then `_dispatch_matrix_job` resolves targets with the lock released — returns
False ⇒ drop the no-work job + try the next). `_end_task` clears `_current_job` and
auto-advances; an error that ends a matrix job (`_on_error`, auth or browser) clears
the pending queue so it can't cascade. **Targets resolve at START, not enqueue**
(`_resolve_compare_cells` / `_resolve_export_steps`), so a job reflects exports done
before it. Snapshot keys: `matrix_queue`, `matrix_current`, `matrix_fast`. New bridge:
`refresh_row_export`/`refresh_column_export`, `set_matrix_fast`,
`matrix_queue_remove|move|clear`, `matrix_stop_all`. Worker: `MatrixBatchExportWorker`
(manifest-free, `workers=N` ⇒ fast). UI: each row/column header has a **two-button
group** (`mxHeaderBtns`: ↻ `i-refresh` re-export + ⟳ `i-compare` rebuild), a Fast
toggle + a live queue panel (`renderQueuePanel` / `mxQueueRow`) in the config zone;
action triggers stay LIVE mid-run (a 2nd click queues) — only selection controls grey.

### The Compare-tab "vs TSN Matrix" (v0.16.0; renamed + generalized v0.16.1)

A second matrix under the **Compare** tab — sub-tab label **"vs TSN Matrix"** (internal
group id stays `tsn_by_day`), appended after the registry `compare_groups`: rows = **every
report type** (HL Excel + PDF, Ramp Summary/Detail, Highway Sequence, Intersection
Summary/Detail — all wired as of v0.17.0), columns = exported **days** you add, each cell = (report, day)
**vs TSN**. ONE source selector (default ssor-prod); no cross-env, no live re-export.
`selectCompareGroup("tsn_by_day")` swaps `#compareClassic` out for `#dayMatrixSection` and
calls `applyMatrixWide()` so it goes **full-width too** (same treatment as the Everything
matrix); `renderDayMatrix` is fed by `gui_api.day_matrix_info`. It **shares** the
TSN-picker component (`mxTsnPicker`, rendered PER ROW — named by its report, like
the Everything matrix), the cell vocab
(`mxCellContent`/`mxActBtn`), and the SAME job queue (the queue panel renders in both
places); day compare Jobs carry `which:"day"` and route to `DayMatrixCompareWorker`.
**Its own config corner** (`#dayMatrixConfig`, shown via `body.matrix-wide.mw-day`) mirrors
`#matrixConfig` and holds the by-day matrix's granular controls — the queue, the **Day
columns** add-day toolbar, a **live-formulas** toggle, and the **Reports** show/hide
toggles (the per-report **TSN dataset** pickers moved to the row headers) — all relocated
out of the grid section so the grid area is as
lean as the Everything matrix's (fits ~5 rows at 1440×720 without scrolling). The by-day
live-formulas toggle is its **own** setting (`day_matrix_formulas`, snapshot key + bridge
`set_day_matrix_formulas`, synced by `syncDayMatrixFormulas`) — independent of the Everything
matrix's `matrix_formulas`; the **evidence-images pair** (`#dayMatrixEvidence` +
`#dayMatrixEvidenceCount`, `syncDayMatrixEvidence`) is by contrast the SAME shared setting as
the Everything matrix's. Engine + store: [comparison-engine.md](comparison-engine.md) §12.
Mock + bridge exercised at `/index.html#mock` (Compare ▸ vs TSN Matrix).

**The add-day picker names what each day holds** (2026-09-02, all three day matrices). A
run folder exists as soon as ANY report was pulled that day, so a bare date in the picker
read like a full export when it might hold one Ramp Summary. Every option now reads
`2026-08-31  ·  HL HSL RD` — the catalog's short codes (`report_catalog.short_code`, one
per export key, asserted unique at import) of the reports actually exported that day for
THIS matrix, in row order, from the snapshot's `available_day_reports` (each matrix module's
`available_day_reports(source)` over the ONE shared walk, `artifact_store.exported_subdirs_by_day`,
which applies the same real-export-file test as `available_days`, so a day is offered exactly
when it carries at least one tag). An export-less today says `today — nothing exported yet`;
the PDF-vs-Excel picker tags a family with both editions `HL` and a one-edition family
`HL:xlsx` / `HL:pdf` (a cell it cannot build). One renderer, `mxDayOptionText`, serves the
three pickers; an older bridge without the map falls back to the bare date.

**Every day says which TSMIS site it came from** (v0.49.0, all four day matrices). Run
folders record the site (`2026-10-07 ssor-prod dev-site`). Since v0.49.1 the source
picker offers every source on both sites — `SSOR / Prod · main site`,
`SSOR / Prod · dev site`, … (`matrix.day_source_options`; the value saved is
`ssor-prod dev-site`) — so a matrix compares either site's exports whatever the app
points at, plus the days from before the site was recorded (see
[architecture.md](architecture.md#run-folders-v0100-replaces-bare-dated-outputs-site-tag-v0490)).
The snapshot's `day_hosts` (date → `main` / `dev` / `other`, or null) puts the site under
every day column header (`mxDaySiteTag`) and into every add-day option —
`2026-10-07  ·  dev site  ·  HL HSL RD`, or `2026-10-02  ·  site not recorded  ·  RS` for a
day exported before v0.49.0, which could be from either site. An older bridge without
`day_hosts` shows neither. On the vs TSN matrix, `snap.exportable` is false when the
source is not on the site the app exports from: the today-column, row and cell export
actions are left out and **Export today** is disabled with the reason in its tooltip.
The env-access flags key on `snap.source_env` (`ssor-prod`), not the site-qualified source.

### The Compare-tab "vs Baseline Matrix" (v0.26.0)

A **third** matrix sub-tab under Compare (group id `baseline_by_day`, appended beside
"vs TSN Matrix"): rows = the same 12 report types, columns = exported **days** you add,
each cell = (report, day) **vs a picked baseline** — an earlier day, or the
Export-Everything store, for the same source. Same-format on both sides by construction;
**compare-only** (no export actions, no TSN pickers, no consolidated badges, no evidence
cameras — `compare_folders` reads the per-route files straight from both folders).
`selectCompareGroup("baseline_by_day")` swaps in `#baselineMatrixSection`, full-width via
`body.matrix-wide.mw-bl`; `renderBaselineMatrix` is fed by `gui_api.baseline_matrix_info`.
The **Source + Baseline selects** live in the section head — the baseline picker lists the
store + every exported day with its report coverage ("2026-06-11 (9/22 reports)"), the
per-report half renders as the cells' "baseline not exported" state, and the baseline's own
day column renders "baseline" cells (highlighted `.mx-baseline-col`, not rebuildable). Its
config corner (`#baselineMatrixConfig`) holds the shared queue panel, the add-day toolbar,
its OWN live-formulas toggle (`baseline_matrix_formulas`, `syncBaselineMatrixFormulas`) and
the report toggles. Jobs carry `which:"baseline"` → `BaselineMatrixCompareWorker` on the
same queue. Engine + store: [comparison-engine.md](comparison-engine.md) §12c.
Mock + bridge exercised at `/index.html#mock` (Compare ▸ vs Baseline Matrix).

### The Compare-tab "PDF vs Excel Matrix" (v0.31.0)

The **fourth** matrix, and the only one whose two sides come from the *same* run
folder: the 11 dual-edition families (5 until v0.48.0) × exported days, each cell self-checking that
day's PDF export against its Excel export. It was built ON the
`report_catalog.MATRIX` wiring the same day that wiring landed, which is what
proved the wiring — a new matrix cost a table row per report instead of a fifth
if-chain. Lives in `pdf_excel_matrix.py`; the sub-tab renders through the same
`ui-matrix.js` as the other three.

### The ArcGIS tab (v0.29.0; Layers since v0.46.0; ArcGIS reports + Reports vs ArcGIS since v0.47.0)

The one tab that never touches the TSMIS site. Everything builds from the
`arcgis_layers/` library, which the app refreshes itself; `gui_arcgis_api.py`
(ArcGIS reports, the matrix, Clean Road) and `gui_arcgis_layers_api.py` (Layers) own
the endpoints, and `ui-arcgis.js` + `ui-arcgis-reports.js` render them. Four
sub-tabs in the order the work flows — layers → the reports built from them → every
export compared against those reports — with Layers first (and the default):

- **Layers** (v0.46.0) — replaces the owner's manual per-layer export.
  - **ArcGIS Pro card** — where ArcGIS Pro's `arcgispro-py3` python.exe was found
    (`arcgis_pro.find_python`: the `SOFTWARE\ESRI\ArcGISPro\InstallDir` registry
    value, then the default install folders), a **Choose python.exe…** override
    (persisted as `arcgis_python`) with **Find it automatically** to clear it, and
    **Check ArcGIS Pro**: a queued job that starts ArcPy, reads + exports the
    27-row SHS Tolls layer and compares that file with the library's copy (same
    columns? domain labels or codes?). The last check's result stays on the card.
  - **Layer library card** — the 40 library layers as a table: name with the builds
    that read it (`arcgis_refresh.layer_users`, from the registry's
    `REQUIRED_LAYERS`), rows, exported (each layer's own time), size, and the last
    refresh's per-layer outcome. **Refresh all layers** (confirms first) or tick
    layers and **Refresh selected**; both queue an `arcgis_refresh` job on the
    shared matrix queue, so builds/comparisons line up behind it and never read a
    half-swapped library. Progress shows the layer being exported; Cancel stops
    the worker.
  - **How a refresh runs** — the app cannot carry ArcPy, so
    `arcgis_worker/export_layers.py` (shipped as a plain `.py` data file) runs in
    ArcGIS Pro's own Python, launched directly (no shell), without a window, with
    a clean environment and the frozen app's DLL directory reset — the pattern the
    TSMIS Project Inspector proved on the work PC. The worker reads each layer
    straight from the `lrs_tsmis` FeatureServer by URL (ArcGIS Pro's sign-in is the
    credential; the service's layer list, read once with `arcpy.GetSigninToken()`,
    matches layers by NAME, with the 2026-08-19 ids as the fallback) and writes it
    with ArcGIS's **Table To Excel** (field names as headers, coded domains as their
    descriptions — the manual export's dialect). It appends JSON events to a file;
    `arcgis_refresh` checks each finished file (header readable, data rows counted
    from the sheet XML, never fewer than ArcGIS's server count), swaps it in under
    its existing library name (the replaced file goes to `_previous/`), and
    rewrites `00_INDEX.xlsx` with two new columns — *Exported At* (that layer's
    export start) and *Exported By*. If the manifest can't be written (open in
    Excel) the swap is undone. Limits: 10 min for ArcPy to start; 90 min per
    layer, or — once the worker has counted a big layer — 12 ms a row
    (`arcgis_pro.layer_limit_for`, v0.47.0: County Code's 824,914 rows took 54 min
    on the first real refresh, so it gets about 2 h 45 min).
    `arcgis_layers/_refresh/last_run.json` / `last_probe.json` feed the card.
- **ArcGIS reports** (v0.47.0) — every TSMIS report rendered from the layers, as a
  table in the Layers look (`ui-arcgis-reports.js`, payload `arcgis_reports_info` →
  `arcgis_matrix.reports_snapshot`). One row per `arcgis_reports` registry report:
  its name with what Reports vs ArcGIS compares against it (*compared with
  Highway Detail · Highway Detail (PDF)*), the build's as-of date and when it was
  built, its rows, and a status — *current* (green) / *built from older layers —
  refresh it* / *outcome unknown* (warning colour) / *not built yet* / *N layers
  missing* / *last refresh failed …* (the failed or cancelled attempt is kept, in the
  shared attempts overlay under `output/arcgis_reports/_state/`, until a refresh
  lands) / *building…* / *waiting…*. A report whose build hasn't been written is
  listed too, greyed *build coming later*, so the whole set is visible.
  - **Refresh all reports** (confirms first, naming the reports) or a row's
    **Refresh** / **Build** queues ONE `kind:"arcgis_build"` job whose `rows` are the
    reports, built one after another (`ArcgisReportBuildWorker`, in
    `gui_worker_arcgis.py`); progress names the report being built, Cancel stops
    between reports and inside one. The **As of** box rebuilds as of a past date;
    blank is the layers' own date.
  - **One build per report, refreshed in place** (owner decisions 2026-09-02 /
    2026-10-05). Every build stamps the layer drop it came from — the drop's export
    date (the OLDEST layer's *Exported At*, or a manual manifest's own timestamp)
    and a content fingerprint over the `.xlsx` files — into its marker sheet and
    outcome sidecar (`layer_drop` under the module's `SIDECAR_KEY`), so refreshing
    the layers makes the row read *built from older layers* without anyone
    re-checking by hand. The as-of defaults to the OLDEST export date among the
    layers that report reads (`arcgis_layers.consistent_asof`), never the TSN
    extract's — that default belongs to the Clean Road sub-tab only. A build gates
    on the report's OWN required layers (`REQUIRED_LAYERS`), not the whole manifest.
- **Reports vs ArcGIS** (renamed from *Reports vs layers* in v0.47.0) — a by-day
  **matrix**: rows = every EXPORT EDITION of every registry report — the Excel export
  and the print (PDF) edition are separate rows (`arcgis_reports.editions()`,
  derived from the catalog) — columns = exported days you add, each cell = that
  day's consolidated export of the row's edition compared against the report's ONE
  ArcGIS build. The row picks the build up by itself (`arcgis_matrix.arcgis_side`,
  the newest — and only — build of that report), so both editions of a report
  compare against the same workbook; nothing on the matrix picks or builds it. Both
  sides are TSMIS, so they should agree. Rows that can't compare yet stay listed,
  compact and greyed, with the reason on hover. The engine is `arcgis_matrix.py`
  ([comparison-engine.md](comparison-engine.md) §12d); it renders through the same
  `ui-matrix.js` primitives as the other four matrices, goes full-width via
  `body.matrix-wide.mw-ag` with its own corner `#arcgisMatrixConfig` (queue,
  add-day, live-formulas, row toggles), and rides the shared job queue
  (`which:"arcgis"` → `ArcgisMatrixCompareWorker`).
  - The **ArcGIS side** card above the grid shows each built report as a chip —
    *as of D · current layers* (green) or *from older layers — refresh it* /
    *not built yet* (warning) — and links to ArcGIS reports. Each row header's
    second line says what it is compared with (*vs ArcGIS as of D*, *· older
    layers*, *no ArcGIS build yet — build it*). A cell whose report has no build
    reads **needs ArcGIS** and offers a build button, which queues that report's
    refresh — after it lands, the row compares with no other step.
  - Rows are the Excel/PDF export keys, and a report's own key is still its
    established row, so the saved hidden rows / row order and the comparisons made
    before v0.47.0 keep applying; the comparison files keep their `_vs_layers`
    names.
- **Clean Road vs TSN** — builds our own CA HIGHWAYS table from the layers as-of a
  chosen date and compares it against the TSN extract, both flavors. The as-of box
  matters: `resolve_default_asof()` takes its default from the *staged TSN
  extract*, not from the layer library, so a build off fresh layers still
  reconstructs the extract's date unless you set it. Kept for when the TSN extract
  needs re-checking; the same CA HIGHWAYS build is the Clean Road: Highway report
  on ArcGIS reports.

Statewide builds are long (~25–30 min for Highway Detail, ~7 min for CA HIGHWAYS),
so every flow is cancellable and reports progress through the same `Events` sink as
an export.

**Extending it** — a new report is a registry row plus its build and comparator
modules (`arcgis_reports.py`); ArcGIS reports, the matrix rows (both editions), the
endpoints, the `#mock` preview and `check_arcgis_matrix` derive from the registry,
and an edition becomes comparable on its own once the app consolidates it. Read
[planning/cleanroad-highways.md](planning/cleanroad-highways.md) first for the
measured build rules, and don't re-derive them. Mock + bridge exercised at
`/index.html#mock` (ArcGIS ▸ Layers / ArcGIS reports / Reports vs ArcGIS). The
refresh is proven offline by `check_arcgis_refresh` and the frozen `--self-test`,
both of which run the SHIPPED worker against the stand-in ArcPy in
`arcgis_selftest.py`; real ArcPy only exists on the work PC — its first real run
(2026-10-05, v0.46.0) exported all 40 layers cleanly.

### Matrix cell states, and the one that is deliberately not green

`ui-matrix.js` renders a cell from `cmp` state. Beyond the familiar built /
stale / match / failed states, v0.41.0 added **`mx-preview`**: a counts-only
result showing the difference count in grey with *"counts only — build to
certify"*. It is checked BEFORE the built/stale/match branches and can never
render as `mx-match` — a zero-difference preview reads `match*`, never a green
tick. That is enforced structurally rather than by convention (see
[comparison-engine.md](comparison-engine.md) §2c) and asserted by
`build/check_comparison_preview.py`, which reads this file to prove the branch
order and the absence of `mx-match`. **If you reorder the branches in
`ui-matrix.js`, that check fails — which is the point.**

v0.41.2 added one sub-state inside that branch. A counts-only run writes no
file, so a stale cell's existing workbook is untouched; when the preview
re-derives that workbook's own published counts, the cell reads **"counts
confirmed"** — the same `mx-preview` class plus an `mx-confirmed` accent class
(success-coloured left edge + sub-line, muted background and italic number
unchanged). It answers the only question a stale cell raises — *do the saved
numbers still hold?* — without claiming the file itself is current, because
equal totals don't mean equal rows. Same rule as the parent state: accent, never
promotion, and `confirms` never reaches `_staleness`.

The toggle behind all of this is the counts-only checkbox in each matrix's
config zone. It has its OWN bridge endpoint (`set_matrix_preview_only`), like
every other matrix toggle, because `matrix_preview_only` is a stored-only-when-on
flag outside `settings.DEFAULTS` — the generic `set_setting` drops keys it
doesn't know. It shipped wired to `set_setting` in v0.41.0 and so clicked,
reported success, saved nothing, and snapped back on the next state sync
(fixed v0.41.2). `set_setting` now REFUSES an unknown key instead of returning
`ok`, and `check_ui_contract` asserts both that every `set_setting` key in the
UI is a real DEFAULTS key and that this toggle calls its own endpoint.

### One-stop EXPORT on the by-day matrix (v0.17.0)

The by-day matrix is the **export + consolidate + compare-vs-TSN** home for
individually-pulled days (the Everything matrix stays the always-current health view).
**"Export today →"** (footer, accent) — or the today **column-header ↻**, a **row ↻**, or
a **today cell's ↻** — pulls a fresh **dated run folder** `output/<today> <src-env>/` for
the matrix source, then auto-chains the consolidate + compare so the new column **fills
itself**. **Only today is exportable**: `day_matrix_snapshot.today` gates every export
control (past columns show no export action — their pull stays the immutable record handed
to the vendor; you can still rebuild/compare them). Plumbing: `export_day_column/row/cell`
→ a `which:"day"` **export** Job → `MatrixBatchExportWorker(dated=True)` (the
`_run_matrix_export_step(dated=True)` writes the dated folder via `out_base=None`, site set
to the matrix source like `BatchWorker`); on `matrix_export_done` for a day job,
`_on_matrix_export_done` enqueues the matching **compare** Job (skipped on cancel). Fast
mode + worker count reuse the **shared** `matrix_fast`/`fast_workers` knob (the by-day
corner's `#dayMatrixFast`/`#dayMatrixWorkers` stay in sync with the Everything matrix /
Export pane / Settings via `syncDayMatrixFast`); **pause/resume + skip** (`#btnDayPause`/
`#btnDaySkip`, shown while a `which:"day"` export runs) forward to the engine like a normal
export. Foundation note: a future **district-wide** pull (TSN HL/HSL are per-district) would
widen `_resolve_day_export_steps` to per-district steps — the dated/site/queue machinery
already fits. Golden `check_day_matrix` (today-gating, dated worker, export→compare chain);
mock + bridge at `/index.html#mock`.

### Env-check flags on the matrices (v0.17.0)

Both matrices reuse the Export tab's amber convention to surface what the **env-access**
scan flagged. `applyMatrixEnvFlags()` (app.js) overlays `S.st.env_access` (keyed
`"<src>-<env>"` → `reports[<registry label>]` = `ok|greyed|missing`) onto the
already-rendered grid — cheap class/tooltip toggles over cells/headers stamped with
`data-rk`/`data-env`/`data-label`, so it re-runs on any state push without a rebuild.
The **Everything** matrix is report×env, so it flags precisely: the **cell** (amber inset
border + "export may fail" tooltip), its **row header** (amber when flagged in any shown
env), and the **env column header** (`mx-env-warn` amber / `mx-env-bad` red for a
whole-env verdict). The **by-day** matrix is report×day under one `snap.source` env, so it
flags the **row header**. It re-overlays live from `dispatch`'s `state` case (when a matrix
tab is visible) and on `matrix_refresh`, so the quiet background active-env check (auth
§4a) keeps the flags current. The lookup works because the matrix `row_labels` ARE the
EXPORT_REPORTS labels (`reports.matrix_rows()` → `EXPORT_REPORTS[idx][0]`) — exactly the
`env_access.reports` key. Verified at `/index.html#mock` (seeded `env_access`).

### Export-browser indicator + quiet active-env check (v0.17.0)

The title-bar **Browser dropdown is gone**, replaced by a read-only **indicator**
(`#exportBrowserInd`, fed by `state.export_browser` = `{normal, fast, dot, cls_label}` from
`_export_browser_view`) of what will actually export — e.g. "Google Chrome · saved login"
or "Microsoft Edge · one-click". The only real choice — **Built-in Chromium vs installed
Chrome** — moved to **Settings ▸ Export browser** (`renderExportBrowser`: radios when both
exist, else an info line), persisted via `set_export_browser`; Edge is the implicit
one-click path, not pickable. On app start + env switch the GUI quietly proves one-click
and refreshes the active env's report flags via the background **active-env check** — full
detail in [auth-and-signin.md](auth-and-signin.md) §4 / §4a. **Title-bar vs card trap
applies:** the indicator uses `--titlebar-*` tokens (`.tb-ind`), the Settings radios are
card controls.

### Drag-to-reorder matrix rows + columns (v0.17.0 Phase 4b)

Each row/column header carries a small drag grip (`dndAttach` in app.js — one HTML5-DnD
helper shared by both matrices). Dropping reorders: the new key order is persisted via the
bridge (`set_matrix_row_order` / `set_matrix_env_order` / `set_day_matrix_row_order` →
`settings.{matrix_row_order,matrix_env_order,day_matrix_row_order}`) and re-rendered. The
**backend applies the order** — `matrix.apply_order(keys, order)` treats the saved list as a
sort key over the ACTUAL visible rows/columns (named keys first, then the rest in natural
order), so it's a pure display preference: unknown/stale keys are ignored, a report/env/day
added or removed later degrades gracefully, and a hidden row is never resurrected by the order
list. The drop indicator (`--primary` edge via `.dnd-before-/.dnd-after-{x,y}`) shows the
insert point. Verified at `/index.html#mock` (synthetic drag on both matrices, rows + env
columns, persistence across re-render) + golden `check_matrix.test_reorder` /
`check_matrix_bridge` (bridge round-trip).

### Settings ▸ TSN reports panel (v0.17.0)

The canonical TSN library ([comparison-engine.md](comparison-engine.md) / `tsn_library.py`) gets a
status panel in Settings (`#setTsnLibrary`, rendered by `renderTsnLibrary` from
`get_settings().tsn_library`). A header line shows the **on-disk folder** (`tsn_library_root`
= `paths.TSN_LIBRARY_ROOT`; each report keeps its raw + consolidated files in a `<report>`
subfolder) with an **Open folder** button (`open_tsn_library_folder` → `_open_folder`); each
row's name tooltips that report's `raw_dir`. The library is **self-documenting**:
`tsn_library.ensure_layout()` seeds every report's `<report>/raw/` folder with a hint file
naming the expected format, plus a root README — run at GUI start AND before Open folder, so a
fresh install never shows an empty folder (v0.17.1). The matrix **Choose…** picker
(`pick_matrix_tsn_file`) also defaults its dialog into that report's library folder, not the
legacy per-run `_tsn_input/` location. Then one row per registered report: a **dot** (green = consolidated
current · amber = missing/stale-or-raw-not-yet-built · grey = no raw imported), a status line
(`N raw <kind> · consolidated current|STALE|not yet built`), and two actions —
**Import raw…** (`import_tsn_raw`: a native multi-file dialog, PDFs or the statewide workbook
per the report's `raw_kind`, copied into the library via `tsn_library.import_raw`) and
**Rebuild** (`rebuild_tsn_library`: builds the consolidated/normalized workbook via
`tsn_library.build_consolidated(force=True)` on the shared single-task slot, reusing
`ConsolidateWorker`). The bridge methods refresh the panel: Import returns the fresh rows;
Rebuild sets `S._tsnRebuildPending` and the `"state"` handler re-fetches `tsn_library_status()`
once the task slot frees. Mock + bridge exercised at `/index.html#mock` (Settings ▸ TSN reports)
and golden `check_gui_bridge.test_tsn_library_panel`.

## Motion layer + control polish

A light app-wide motion system (end of `app.css`, `prefers-reduced-motion`-aware),
driven by a **motion-token scale** in `:root`: `--motion-instant` (80ms `:active`
press), `--motion-fast` (120ms hover/colour), `--motion` (180ms entrances + list
inserts), `--motion-slow` (240ms panes), `--motion-theme` (500ms theme fade), plus
`--ease-out` / `--ease-pop`. Entrances: tab panes rise+fade (`pane-in`), sub-panes
cross-fade, popovers/modals `pop-in`/`modal-in`, and per-element inserts for
**activity-log lines** (`line-in`), the **env stepper** + **worker rows** (`rise-in`),
**saved-report rows**, and the preflight↔progress↔completion **lifecycle cards**.
Buttons/tabs have a tactile `:active` press; the theme toggle runs a **slower
light↔dark cross-fade** — `app.js withThemeTransition()` adds `html.theme-anim` for the
change window, and the `@media (prefers-reduced-motion)` block **re-overrides that
`!important` transition** so reduced-motion still snaps (and zeroes transform-on-hover
end-states the duration clamp alone can't).

**Control-polish conventions** (the matrix controls set the bar; the rest of the app
matches it — keep it that way): tints are always
`color-mix(in oklab, var(--token) N%, <surface>)`, never hardcoded literals; focus is a
2px `var(--ring)` ring on inset/ghost controls, while the filled `.btn` keeps its
offset **double-ring** so focus stays visible on a primary fill; compact-control
heights come from `--control-h-sm`/`--control-h-md`. **Title-bar vs card trap:**
title-bar controls (`.tb-select`, `.btn-icon`, `.btn-titlebar`, `.status-chip`) MUST
keep `--titlebar-*` tokens + faint white fills; card controls (`select-light`, the
matrix controls, `.btn-*` on cards) use `--card`/`--foreground`/`--input-border` — a
card skin on the dark bar (or the bar skin on a light card) goes invisible.

NOTE: the `#mock` is rendered headless, which does not advance CSS transitions — verify
motion *end-states* + that the rules apply (animation-name / computed values), and watch
the actual motion in the real WebView2 window.
