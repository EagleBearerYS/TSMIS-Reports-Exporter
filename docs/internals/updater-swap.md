# Self-Updater Internals

Scope: the code-level walkthrough of the GUI's one-click self-updater — `scripts/updater.py` end to end (check → download/stage → swap-mode reinstall → cleanup), the `gui_main.py` swap-mode branch, the GUI wiring in `gui_api.py`/`gui_worker.py`, and the `release.yml` publish side the updater trusts. Deepens [../build-and-release.md](../build-and-release.md) (the scannable what/why owner). Read that first for the high-level table of phases; this doc is the "how it actually works, line by line" companion you need before touching the swap.

> All anchors are `file:symbol` or `file:Lnn` against the repo at the time of writing. Every constant/identifier below is exact.

---

## 0. The actors and where state lives

| Piece | File | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `updater.py` | `scripts/updater.py` | Console-free core. Raises `UpdateError` (UI-neutral message), logs every decision to `tsmis.update`. |
| `UpdateWorker` | `gui_worker.py:1354` | Worker thread that drives `check` / `download` / `revert`. Posts `("update_status", dict)` to the GUI queue. |
| `GuiApi` update methods | `gui_api.py` | `check_updates`, `update_start`, `update_apply`, `open_release_page`, `revert_to_previous`, `_on_update_status`, `_start_update_check`. Own the `self._update` snapshot. |
| swap-mode branch | `gui_main.py:main` (L74–76) | Branches into `updater.run_swap_mode` **before any heavy init** when `--apply-update` is in argv. |
| `release.yml` | `.github/workflows/release.yml` | Publishes the 3 zips + 3 `<asset>.sha256` the updater downloads and verifies. |

**The single in-process state is `GuiApi._update`** — a plain dict whose `phase` drives the title-bar pill. Phases (from the `_on_update_status` docstring at `gui_api.py:151–154`):
`idle | checking | none | available | downloading | staged | applying | failed`.
The matching `UpdateInfo` object is held Python-side in `GuiApi._update_info` (never serialized to JS — it carries the asset URL).

**Updater logger:** `log = logging.getLogger("tsmis.update")` (`updater.py:67`). The swap process is the exception: it runs before logging is set up and writes by **direct file appends** to `update_helper.log` via `_swap_log` (see §6).

**Constants worth pinning (`updater.py:69–83, 446–449`):**

```
GITHUB_REPO   = "EagleBearerYS/TSMIS-Reports-Exporter"
RELEASES_PAGE = https://github.com/<repo>/releases/latest
_API_LATEST   = https://api.github.com/repos/<repo>/releases/latest
_API_RELEASES = https://api.github.com/repos/<repo>/releases?per_page=100
_EXE_NAME     = APP_NAME + ".exe"          # "TSMIS Exporter.exe"
_BUNDLE_ITEMS = (_EXE_NAME, "_internal", "Start Here.txt", "IT-README.txt")   # the swap allowlist
_CHUNK        = 256 * 1024                  # stream read size
_API_TIMEOUT_S = 20      _DL_TIMEOUT_S = 60 # socket read timeout while streaming
SWAP_FLAG     = "--apply-update"
_SWAP_TIMEOUT_S = 120    # max wait for the old PID to exit
_RETRY_ATTEMPTS = 12     _RETRY_DELAY_S = 0.5  # Defender/slow-handle retry cadence
```

> **`GITHUB_REPO` is the single source of truth.** `GITHUB_REPO = "EagleBearerYS/TSMIS-Reports-Exporter"` (`updater.py`; the repository's CURRENT owner and name, never a renamed account's old one — `check_updater` compares it with the `origin` remote) drives both the GitHub API calls and `safe_release_url`'s host allowlist. The docs all use this same owner; if the repo ever moves, this one line is the place to change for both the API and the URL gate.

---

## 1. `update_support()` — the capability gate (every path checks it)

`updater.py:update_support()` returns `(verdict, reason)`:

| Verdict | Condition | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `"off"` | `not is_frozen()` | Dev/console run — no bundle to replace. |
| `"link"` | frozen **but** `DATA_ROOT != install_dir()` | App folder is read-only; `paths.py` redirected data to `%LOCALAPPDATA%`. Can only point at the release page. |
| `"ok"` | frozen **and** `DATA_ROOT == install_dir()` | Writable onefolder install — full one-click update. |

`install_dir()` = `Path(sys.executable).resolve().parent` (`updater.py:105`). `DATA_ROOT` is resolved once at `paths.py` import (`paths.py:_resolve_data_root`): frozen → exe dir if `_writable`, else `%LOCALAPPDATA%\TSMIS Exporter`. **So the entire "link" tier is decided by whether the exe folder passed `paths._writable`'s probe-file test at startup.** This is the only thing that distinguishes a normal install from a read-only one for update purposes.

`download_and_stage` and `apply_update_and_restart` both re-assert `update_support()=="ok"` and raise `UpdateError` otherwise (`updater.py:340–342, 460–462`) — defense in depth, since the GUI already gates.

---

## 2. `check_for_update()` — is there a newer release?

Entry: `check_for_update(current_version=None, variant=None)` (`updater.py:185`). The two args exist only for tests; defaults are this build.

Flow:
1. `cur = parse_version(current_version or __version__)`. `parse_version` (`updater.py:157`) matches `v?(\d+(?:\.\d+)*)$` → tuple of ints, or `None` if unparseable.
2. `want = variant or current_variant()`. `current_variant()` (`updater.py:125`) returns `"win64-with-browser"` iff `install_dir()/_internal/ms-playwright` is a dir, else `"win64"` — **the same probe `paths.py` uses** for `BUNDLED_BROWSERS_DIR` (`paths.py:235`). This is what makes a with-browser install download the with-browser zip.
3. `_http_get(_API_LATEST, _API_TIMEOUT_S)` → `json.load`.
4. Error handling:
   - `HTTPError` **404** → `return None` ("repo exists but has no releases yet") — not an error.
   - Any other `HTTPError` → `UpdateError("...HTTP {code}")`.
   - `(OSError, ValueError)` (covers `URLError`/SSL/timeout/bad JSON) → `UpdateError("could not reach github.com…")`.
5. Parse `tag_name`; if `parse_version` returns `None`, log + `return None` (unrecognized tag, not a hard error).
6. `is_newer(remote, cur)` (`updater.py:165`) → zero-pads both tuples to equal length, compares numerically (so `0.10.10 > 0.10.4`). Not newer → `return None`.
7. `_asset_info_from_release(data, remote, tag, want)` → `UpdateInfo`.

### `_http_get` — the TLS contract (do not change)

`updater.py:_http_get` (L174):

```python
return urllib.request.urlopen(req, timeout=timeout,
                              context=ssl.create_default_context())
```

`ssl.create_default_context()` trusts the **Windows certificate store**, so corporate TLS-inspection roots keep working where a bundled CA list (certifi) would reject the handshake; `urllib` also picks up the system proxy from the registry. The `User-Agent` is `"<App-Name>/<ver> (self-update)"` and `Accept: application/vnd.github+json`. The repo is public → no token. **This is load-bearing on locked-down corporate networks — never swap it for `requests`/`certifi`.**

### `_asset_info_from_release` — pick the variant's zip + its checksum

`updater.py:223`. Shared by both the latest-update check and the revert resolver so they select assets identically.

1. `suffix = f"-{want}.zip"`; find the first asset whose `name` ends with it. **None → `UpdateError`** "version {tag} is out, but its download package isn't available yet" (the variant's zip isn't published).
2. Companion checksum: look for an asset named exactly `<zip>.sha256`; carry its `browser_download_url` into `UpdateInfo.asset_sha256_url`.
3. Returns `UpdateInfo(version, tag, asset_name, asset_url, asset_size, release_url=html_url or RELEASES_PAGE, asset_digest=asset["digest"], asset_sha256_url)`.

`UpdateInfo` (`updater.py:90`) is the contract carried through the rest of the pipeline. `asset_size` defaults to `0` if the API omits it (matters for the disk-space and completeness checks below).

---

## 3. `download_and_stage()` — the heavy step (worker thread)

`updater.py:336`. Returns the path to the staged tree (`UPDATE_DIR/staged`). `UPDATE_DIR = _PRIVATE/update` = `data\update` frozen (`paths.py:210`). `on_progress(done_bytes, total_bytes)` is called as the stream advances.

Numbered flow:

1. **Capability re-check** — `update_support()!="ok"` → `UpdateError`.
2. **Fresh staging area** — if `UPDATE_DIR` exists, `shutil.rmtree`; a failure (something has a handle open) → `UpdateError("could not clear the update folder…")`. Then `mkdir(parents=True)`. *Invariant: two versions' files never mix.*
3. **Disk-space guard** — only when `asset_size` known: `need = asset_size * 3` (zip + extracted tree + headroom); compares to `shutil.disk_usage(UPDATE_DIR).free`. Short → `UpdateError` naming the MB needed/available.
4. **Stream the zip** — open `zip_path = UPDATE_DIR/(asset_name or "update.zip")`, loop `resp.read(_CHUNK)`:
   - write chunk to disk,
   - `hasher.update(chunk)` (running SHA-256),
   - `done += len(chunk)`, fire `on_progress(done, total)` where `total = asset_size or Content-Length`.
   `OSError` mid-stream → `UpdateError("the update download failed…")`.
5. **Completeness** — if `asset_size` known and `done != asset_size` → `UpdateError` "incomplete".
6. **SHA-256 verify** (see §3.1) — mismatch deletes the zip and raises; **no checksum → FAIL-CLOSED** (abort + show the release page; no size-only fallback).
7. **Extract** — `zipfile.ZipFile(zip_path).extractall(extract_dir)`; `BadZipFile`/`OSError` → `UpdateError("not a valid app package")`. **Then `zip_path.unlink()` immediately** — frees ~150 MB before the app keeps running.
8. **Locate + rename the bundle root** — `_bundle_root(extract_dir)` (§3.2), then `_retry(lambda: root.rename(staged))` (instant — same volume). Clean up `extract_dir` if it wasn't the root itself, via `_retry(rmtree)` with a best-effort `ignore_errors` fallback so leftover-cleanup trouble can't abort an otherwise-good stage.
9. **Sanity assert** — `staged/_EXE_NAME` is a file AND `staged/_internal` is a dir, else `UpdateError("missing expected app files")`.
10. `return staged`.

> **✅ Fixed (this update) — `update-stage-rename-no-retry`.** Step 8's rename used to be a
> **bare** `root.rename(staged)` (`updater.py:416`) with no retry. If Windows Defender / the
> Search indexer was still scanning the freshly-extracted `data\update\extract\TSMIS Exporter`
> tree, it failed with **`PermissionError: [WinError 5] Access is denied`** and aborted the
> whole stage → the GUI showed "Update problem", `cleanup_leftovers` dropped the staged
> download, and the user **re-downloaded and it worked** (the scan had finished). It was
> **asymmetric with `perform_swap`** (§6), whose every file op is wrapped in `_retry`
> (`_RETRY_ATTEMPTS=12 × _RETRY_DELAY_S=0.5 s`, *"Defender / slow handle release"*).
> **Observed twice on the work PC** (2026-06-17 ~09:20 and 2026-06-18 ~09:39, both morning;
> every *swap* that actually started always succeeded). The rename + cleanup `rmtree` are now
> wrapped in the same `_retry`, so a transient lock retries instead of aborting. Locked by
> `check_updater.py` (`test_stage_rename_retries`, `test_retry_recovers_transient_oserror`).
> ⚠ The Defender timing only reproduces on the work PC — field-verify there.

### 3.1 `_expected_sha256` — where the trust comes from

`updater.py:310`. Returns lowercase-hex SHA-256 or `None`:

1. **Prefer the companion `<asset>.sha256`** (`asset_sha256_url`): fetch up to 4096 bytes over the same TLS, take the first whitespace token, accept iff it fully matches `[0-9a-f]{64}` (handles the `sha256sum` format `"<hash>  <name>"`). Unrecognized content or fetch error → warn, fall through.
2. **Fallback: GitHub API's own `digest`** (`asset_digest`, format `"sha256:HEX"`): strip the prefix, accept iff 64 hex chars.
3. Neither → `None`.

Back in `download_and_stage`: `actual = hasher.hexdigest()`; `expected = _expected_sha256(info)`.
- `expected` present and `actual != expected` → `zip_path.unlink(missing_ok=True)` + `UpdateError("didn't match its published checksum…")`. **Refuses to extract or swap unverified bytes.**
- `expected` present and matches → log "SHA-256 verified".
- **`expected` is `None` → FAIL-CLOSED (P10).** The download is deleted and `UpdateError("this update could not be verified (no published checksum)…install it manually from the releases page")` is raised — the install **aborts** and shows the release page. There is **no size-only fallback any more** (the v0.17.x "proceed on size only" was removed in P10). Because `release.yml` publishes a `.sha256` for every variant and the API `digest` is the backup, the verified path is the normal path; only a truly checksum-less release fails closed.

> **Scope of the guard (stated in the docstring):** the checksum arrives over the *same* TLS as the rest of the check, so it protects against a corrupted / truncated / wrong-asset download — **NOT a forged release**. A forged release would carry a matching forged checksum. Code-signing is the planned complete fix.
>
> **Staged re-hash before swap (P10).** After a clean extract, `download_and_stage` records a digest over the ENTIRE launchable bundle tree (`staged.sha256`); `apply_update_and_restart` re-verifies it immediately **before** launching the swap exe, so tampering with the staged tree while it sat in a user-writable folder is caught (fail-closed). Extraction is also guarded against zip-slip (every member path validated before `extractall`), and the download has a socket timeout + bounded retry.

### 3.2 `_bundle_root` — the `Compress-Archive` wrapper

`updater.py:426`. `release.yml` zips with `Compress-Archive -Path "dist\TSMIS Exporter"`, which wraps the bundle in one top-level `TSMIS Exporter\` folder. So:
- if `extract_dir/_EXE_NAME` exists → root is `extract_dir` itself (defensive — handles a flat zip),
- else scan immediate children for the first dir containing `_EXE_NAME`,
- none → `UpdateError("does not contain the app")`.

### 3.3 No Mark-of-the-Web — why this path is immune to the CLR failure

The CLR-blocking MOTW field failure (`gui_main._unblock_dotnet_assemblies` exists to undo it on a manually-downloaded zip) **cannot happen on this path**: browsers add the NTFS `Zone.Identifier` stream; raw `out.write(chunk)` and `zipfile.extractall` do not. The in-app download writes raw bytes, so the extracted `.NET` assemblies are never tagged. (See `gui_main.py:_unblock_dotnet_assemblies` for the manual-install side this avoids.)

---

## 4. `apply_update_and_restart()` — launch the staged exe in swap mode

`updater.py:452`. Called from `GuiApi.update_apply` after the user clicks **Restart to update**, with the **window-close gated on no task running** (`gui_api.py:957`). Returns the swap exe path.

Flow:
1. Re-assert `update_support()=="ok"`.
2. Verify `staged/_EXE_NAME` still on disk → else `UpdateError("no longer on disk — download it again")`.
3. Build the command line:
   ```python
   [str(new_exe), SWAP_FLAG, str(install_dir()), str(os.getpid()), str(helper_log),
    str(ready_file), ready_token]     # ready_file/ready_token: sol-001 handshake
   ```
   `helper_log = LOG_DIR/update_helper.log`. `new_exe` is the **staged** exe (a complete copy of the new app) — it applies itself.
4. `subprocess.Popen(..., creationflags=CREATE_NO_WINDOW | CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP, close_fds=True, cwd=staged, stdin/out/err=DEVNULL)`. Detached, no console window. `OSError` (a policy blocks running it) → `UpdateError("the update process could not be started — install manually")`.
5. **The readiness handshake (sol-001, F-02/F-07 — replaced the old fixed ~2 s death poll).** `apply_update_and_restart` generates a one-use nonce (`secrets.token_hex(24)`) + `ready_file`, passes both as the extra argv above, and calls `_wait_for_helper_ready(...)` for up to `_HELPER_READY_TIMEOUT_S = 15 s` (50 ms polling). The staged helper must publish `ready:<nonce>` **only after it has opened a handle to the still-running original PID** via `_wait_pid_exit`'s `on_waiting` callback. Until then, the original app stays open. Helper death, a bad marker, or a timeout raises `UpdateError("… install manually")` and terminates the unready helper.

   **Marker-read reliability (2026-08-10 field failure).** The first two v0.35.0 restart attempts reached the atomically replaced ready marker but the old app received transient `PermissionError [Errno 13]` while reading it. Non-absence `OSError` reads now retry inside the same 15 s bound; a later exact nonce completes normally. If the marker remains unreadable at the deadline, the update fails closed and the helper is terminated.

   **No unsafe downgrade:** after any marker-access error, the weaker legacy-log fallback is disabled for that launch, even if access later changes. A PRE-handshake Revert helper may still prove it entered the PID wait through its freshly appended `swap started: waiting…` line, but only when no nonce protocol and no marker-access error were observed. An OLD app launching a NEW helper omits the argv tail and the helper retains its plain-wait compatibility path. A current helper can therefore never use its ordinary log line to bypass nonce proof.

   This closes the old silent-failure mode: a blocked, broken, slow, or persistently unreadable helper cannot strand the user with no running app and no swap.

After this returns, `GuiApi.update_apply` spawns `_close_for_update` (`gui_api.py:979`): `sleep(1.2)` to flush the goodbye log line, then `self._window.destroy()` (returns from `webview.start()`, process exits) — falling back to `os._exit(0)` if destroy throws, so the helper can always proceed.

**The control-flow handoff:** the old app is *still running* when the swap exe launches; the swap process's very first action is to wait on the old PID. That ordering is what makes PID-recycle safety work (§6.1).

---

## 5. `gui_main.py` — the swap-mode branch (runs FIRST)

`gui_main.py:main` (L67) — the very first thing, before logging/paths/CLR:

```python
import updater
if updater.SWAP_FLAG in sys.argv:
    updater.run_swap_mode(sys.argv)   # never returns
```

**Why first, before `setup_logging`/paths/CLR (the single most important "why" in this subsystem):** this process is the **staged** exe, running from `install\data\update\staged\`. `paths.py` resolves `DATA_ROOT`/`LOG_DIR`/etc. relative to `Path(sys.executable).parent` — which here is the *staged* tree, **not the install**. If normal path setup ran, every path (logs especially) would aim at the wrong (staged) tree, which the swap is about to delete. So swap mode takes **explicit paths from argv** and logs by direct file appends. It also never creates a window, so the CLR/WebView2 must not load. The branch sits above `setup_logging`, `_unblock_dotnet_assemblies`, `cleanup_leftovers`, and the `gui_api` import — none of those run in swap mode.

`run_swap_mode(argv)` (`updater.py:500`):
1. Parse `i = argv.index(SWAP_FLAG)`; `app_dir = argv[i+1]`, `pid = int(argv[i+2])`, `log_file = argv[i+3]`. Bad argv → `os._exit(2)`.
2. `staged = Path(sys.executable).resolve().parent` (this exe's own tree).
3. `ok = perform_swap(staged, app_dir, pid, log_file)`; `os._exit(0 if ok else 1)`. **Always `os._exit`** — never a normal return, so no atexit/teardown runs in this stripped process.

---

## 6. `perform_swap()` — the two-phase install

`updater.py:576`. Signature: `perform_swap(staged, app_dir, pid, log_file, *, relaunch=True, wait_timeout_s=_SWAP_TIMEOUT_S, show_dialog=True, ready_file=None, ready_token=None)` (the `ready_*` pair is the sol-001 handshake; absent → the legacy plain-wait path). The keyword args let `check_updater.py` drive it against fake trees with `relaunch=False, show_dialog=False`. Returns `True` only when the new version is in place.

Top-level sequence:

```
1. handshake? -> write ready_file "starting:<nonce>"        (sol-001; else skip)
2. _swap_log "waiting for pid …"
3. _wait_pid_exit(pid, wait_timeout_s, on_waiting)          # on_waiting writes "ready:<nonce>" AFTER OpenProcess
                                                            # False on timeout -> "update NOT applied", return False
4. sleep(0.6)                                  # let handles settle
5. assert staged/_EXE_NAME exists              # else "staged update incomplete", return False
6. PHASE 1: copy each allowlisted item -> <name>.new        (old app untouched)
7. PHASE 2: rename live->.old, .new->live, per item         (rollback = renames; sets tree_coherent)
8. if relaunch AND tree_coherent: _relaunch(app_dir, log_file)   # sol-001 F-03: a PARTIAL rollback
                                                            # (tree_coherent False) SKIPS relaunch + logs it,
                                                            # so a mixed-version tree is never started
9. _swap_log "swap done"/"swap failed"; return (failed is None)
```

### 6.1 `_wait_pid_exit` — PID-recycle safety

`updater.py:910`. ctypes only (no psutil in the bundle):

```python
handle = kernel32.OpenProcess(SYNCHRONIZE, False, int(pid))
if not handle:
    if on_waiting is not None: raise OSError  # handshake cannot certify readiness
    return True                               # legacy: already gone (or recycled)
if on_waiting is not None:
    on_waiting()                              # publishes ready:<nonce>
rc = kernel32.WaitForSingleObject(handle, timeout_s*1000)
return rc != WAIT_TIMEOUT
```

The safety argument: `apply_update_and_restart` keeps the original app alive until the helper publishes the nonce, and that publication happens only after `OpenProcess` returns a handle to the live original process. **A held process handle keeps the kernel process object (and thus the PID) reserved until the handle is closed**, so the PID cannot be recycled out from under the wait. In handshake mode an `OpenProcess` failure raises instead of certifying readiness; the helper reports "not applied", exits, and the old app stays open. The return-`True` "already gone" behavior remains only on the legacy no-callback path.

### 6.2 Phase 1 — COPY to `*.new` (the slow, abortable part)

`updater.py:610–648`. The **allowlist** is enforced here:

```python
present = {p.name for p in staged.iterdir()}
extra = sorted(present - set(_BUNDLE_ITEMS))   # logged + ignored
items = [staged/name for name in _BUNDLE_ITEMS if (staged/name).exists()]
```

For each item: `_retry(_remove_tree(new))` then `copytree` (dir) / `copy2` (file) into `app_dir/(name + ".new")`, appending `(name, new)` to `news`. **On any `OSError`:** undo every `.new` already made, log "nothing was changed — the installed version is untouched; update NOT applied", optional `_message_box`, optional `_relaunch`, `return False`.

The heavy ~150 MB `copytree` of `_internal` under live Defender scanning happens **here, while the installed app is completely untouched** — so a failure is a clean abort.

> **Allowlist is a security boundary**, not just hygiene: only `_BUNDLE_ITEMS` are ever copied into the install. A tampered or mis-packaged extra top-level item in the staged tree (e.g. an injected `evil.dll`) is logged and dropped, never installed. `check_updater.py:test_staged_allowlist` plants `evil.dll` and asserts it does not appear in the install and that user `data/` is untouched.

### 6.3 Phase 2 — pure RENAMES (instant; rollback = renames)

`updater.py:650–667`. For each `(name, new)`:

```python
dest = app_dir/name;  bak = app_dir/(name + ".old")
if bak.exists(): _retry(_remove_tree(bak))
if dest.exists(): _retry(dest.rename(bak)); moved.append((dest, bak))
_retry(new.rename(dest))
```

Renames on the same volume are atomic-ish and instant. First `OSError` sets `failed` and **breaks** (stops touching anything further).

**Rollback (L669–689)** runs only if `failed`, and is renames-only:

```python
for dest, bak in reversed(moved):
    if dest.exists(): dest.rename(dest.name + ".new")   # newly-installed piece back to .new
    bak.rename(dest)                                     # .old back into place
```

If every rollback rename succeeds → "previous version restored"; if any fails → "previous version PARTIALLY restored — reinstall from the releases page". On failure `_message_box` shows the user (the app is closed by now).

**Why two phases (the v0.10.2 field failure):** the old one-phase copy wrote directly over `_internal`. A failure mid-`_internal` left a partial tree, and the delete-based rollback could fail on a Defender-held file — so the app relaunched as a NEW exe with PARTIAL/old internals ("says 0.10.2 but features missing"). Phase 2 never *deletes* a fresh tree to roll back; it only renames, so a half-state is impossible.

### 6.4 `_retry` — the Defender cadence

`updater.py:558`. Runs `fn` up to `_RETRY_ATTEMPTS` (12) times, `sleep(_RETRY_DELAY_S=0.5)` on each `OSError`, and **lets the last attempt's error surface**. Wraps every filesystem op in both phases — Defender and slow handle release can briefly hold a file right after the app exits.

### 6.5 `_relaunch` and the leftover cleanup contract

`_relaunch(app_dir, log_file)` (`updater.py:701`) `Popen`s `app_dir/_EXE_NAME` detached. Note it launches **whatever version now sits at `app_dir`** — the new exe on success, the restored old one on rollback.

**The `.old`/`.new` pieces and the staged tree are NOT cleaned up by `perform_swap`.** It can't: it is *running from* `staged`, and on success the live `_internal.old` may still be Defender-held. They're removed by `cleanup_leftovers()` at the relaunched app's next startup (§7), after this process exits and releases its own files.

### 6.6 `last_swap_failure` — surfacing a rolled-back update

`updater.py:724`. Reads the tail (last 60 lines) of `update_helper.log`, ignoring it if older than `max_age_hours=48`. Walks **backwards**: a `"swap done"` line → `return None` (a later success makes earlier failures history); a `"swap FAILED"` or `"update NOT applied"` → return that line. `GuiApi._on_update_status` calls it when an update is re-offered (`gui_api.py:745`) and, if non-None, emits a "the previous update attempt could not be applied" heads-up — closing the field-report loop where an update "applied" but the app reopened on the old version with no explanation.

## 7. `cleanup_leftovers()` + `_clear_webview_caches()` — store recovery every launch / cache + staging frozen-only, before the CLR

`gui_main.py:main` calls `updater.cleanup_leftovers()` right after `_unblock_dotnet_assemblies`, before `import gui_api` (L88–90), wrapped so any exception is logged-not-fatal.

`cleanup_leftovers()` — the order matters (P2/P10):
1. **Always** calls `_recover_store_promotions()` **first** (runs even in dev) — the P2/F2 store-promotion recovery sweep, independent of the update mechanism, so an interrupted Export-Everything swap is repaired from its backup before any store is read.
2. If `not is_frozen()` → **return** (a dev launch serves `scripts/ui` live and has no bundle to clean — so the cache clear + staging removal below are **frozen-only**; the cache clear was moved below this gate in P10).
3. `_clear_webview_caches()` (frozen only).
4. Targets = `[UPDATE_DIR]` + every `install_dir()/(name+suffix)` for `name in _BUNDLE_ITEMS`, `suffix in (".old", ".new")`. Removes each (rmtree dir / unlink file); failures are logged "will retry next launch" — **never raises**. Deliberately removes a **staged-but-never-applied download** so an abandoned stale version is re-offered fresh rather than silently applied later.

`_clear_webview_caches()`: under `WEBVIEW_PROFILE_DIR` (`data\webview2`), globs and rmtrees `Cache`/`Code Cache`/`GPUCache`/`Service Worker` (plus `*/`, `*/*/` nestings) — **never Local Storage** (the theme choice lives there). Rationale: the persistent WebView2 profile could serve a *cached* `app.js`/`index.html` after the on-disk files changed, so a just-updated app would show the OLD UI under the NEW version number. The cache only ever holds the app's own UI files, so clearing it on a **frozen** launch is cheap and kills the whole staleness class (manual zip-overwrite installs included). Wrapped in a bare `except Exception` — a cache-clear failure must never block startup.

## 8. Revert — `resolve_previous_release()`

`updater.py:253`. Powers Settings ▸ Debugging "revert to previous version". Returns an `UpdateInfo` for the **newest FULL release strictly OLDER** than this build, for the current variant; `None` when there's nothing to revert to.

Algorithm:
1. `cur = parse_version(...)`; `None` → return `None`.
2. `_http_get(_API_RELEASES)` — the **list** endpoint (`/releases?per_page=100`), *not* `/latest` (which never returns older tags). 404 → `None`; other errors → `UpdateError`. Non-list body → `None`.
3. Build `candidates`: for each release dict, **skip drafts and prereleases**, parse the tag, keep only `ver` strictly `< cur` (`is_newer(cur, ver)`).
4. `sorted(candidates, key=lambda c: c[0], reverse=True)` — **by version tuple, newest-first; NOT GitHub's list order.** (That list-order bug once broke the dev channel; selection must be by version number.)
5. For each candidate newest-first, try `_asset_info_from_release(rel, ver, tag, want)`. **Variant-skip:** if it raises `UpdateError` (this older release predates the with-browser variant and lacks that zip), log + `continue` to the next-older — *don't* fail with the forward check's "try again later" (wrong message here; that release never had the variant). First success is the revert target.
6. No candidate has the variant → `None`.

`check_updater.py:test_resolve_previous_release` proves all four behaviors: version-not-list-order selection, draft/prerelease exclusion, variant-skip to the next-older release, and `None` when nothing is older.

### Revert wiring (`gui_api.py:revert_to_previous`, L998)

- Refuse unless `update_support()=="ok"` (hidden on dev/read-only).
- Refuse while a `checking`/`downloading`/`applying` is in progress.
- **Refuse while a forward update is `staged`** — reverting would clobber the staged download.
- Otherwise set `self._update = {"phase":"downloading","revert":True}` and start `UpdateWorker(action="revert")`.

`UpdateWorker.run` for `revert` (`gui_worker.py:1393`): calls `resolve_previous_release()`; `None` → posts `phase:"none", revert:True`; else feeds the resolved `UpdateInfo` through **the exact same `download_and_stage`** path as a forward update. So the riskiest code (verify/stage/swap) is unchanged between update and revert — only the *resolution* differs. The pill/dialog text switches to "Reverting…"/"Restart to revert" off the `revert` flag.

---

## 9. `safe_release_url()` — the URL allowlist for the "link"/read-only path

`updater.py:133`. `UpdateInfo.release_url` is the API's `html_url` — external data delivered over TLS, but a forged/MITM'd response could put an arbitrary scheme/host there, and `webbrowser.open()` on a `file:`/`javascript:`/custom-handler value could launch something unexpected. The function returns `url` **only** when `urlsplit` yields `scheme=="https"` AND `hostname.lower()=="github.com"` AND `path.lstrip("/").lower()` starts with `GITHUB_REPO.lower()+"/"`; otherwise it falls back to the hardcoded `RELEASES_PAGE` (which lands on the same place, since updates only ever target the latest release). `GuiApi.open_release_page` (`gui_api.py:993`) routes through it before `webbrowser.open`. `check_updater.py:test_safe_release_url` covers look-alike hosts (`github.com.evil.test`), the `@`-userinfo trick (`github.com@evil.test`), `http://`, `file:`, `javascript:`, and empty/None.

---

## 10. End-to-end flows (who calls what, in order)

### Forward update (happy path)

```
gui_api.check_updates / _start_update_check (auto at launch or version-chip click)
  -> update_support(): "off"->skip, else continue
  -> UpdateWorker("check") -> updater.check_for_update()
       -> posts phase:"available" (+_info) | "none"
gui_api.update_start (user clicks "Update to vX")
  -> phase:"downloading"; UpdateWorker("download", info)
       -> updater.download_and_stage(info, on_progress)   # SHA-256 verify here
       -> posts phase:"downloading"(pct…) then phase:"staged"
gui_api.update_apply (user clicks "Restart to update"; gated on no task)
  -> updater.apply_update_and_restart(staged)
       -> Popen staged exe --apply-update <install> <pid> <helperlog> <readyfile> <nonce>
       -> wait up to 15s for the exact ready nonce; retry transient marker read errors
       -> UpdateError + terminate helper if readiness is unproven          (stay on old version)
  -> _close_for_update(): window.destroy() -> process exits
[staged exe, swap mode]
gui_main.main: SWAP_FLAG in argv -> updater.run_swap_mode(argv)   # BEFORE any init
  -> perform_swap(staged, install, pid, helperlog)
       1. _wait_pid_exit(pid)                # old app exits
       2. phase 1 copy -> *.new              # install untouched
       3. phase 2 rename live->.old, .new->live
       4. _relaunch(install)                 # new exe starts
  -> os._exit(0/1)
[relaunched new app]
gui_main.main: cleanup_leftovers()           # removes *.old/*.new + staged + webview cache
```

### Failure branches at a glance

| Where | Trigger | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `check_for_update` | network/SSL/timeout | `UpdateError` → `phase:"failed"` (logged; quiet unless manual) |
| `download_and_stage` | SHA mismatch | zip deleted, `UpdateError`, nothing staged |
| `download_and_stage` | bad zip / disk full / incomplete | `UpdateError`, nothing staged |
| `apply_update_and_restart` | helper blocked/dies, bad or timed-out handshake, or marker remains unreadable | `UpdateError`; unready helper terminated; **app stays open on old version** |
| `perform_swap` phase 1 | copy `OSError` | abort, delete `.new`, old version intact, relaunch old |
| `perform_swap` phase 2 | rename `OSError` | rename-rollback to old version; `last_swap_failure` reports it next launch |
| `_wait_pid_exit` | old PID never exits in 120 s | "update NOT applied", old version intact |

## 11. The publish side the updater trusts (`release.yml`)

The updater's verification only works because of what `.github/workflows/release.yml` guarantees:

1. **Tag == `version.py`** (`release.yml:47–57`) — reads `__version__`, asserts `TAG == "v<version>"`, fails otherwise. So `check_for_update`'s `tag_name` comparison against `__version__` is meaningful.
2. **Two self-test gates** before any zip is built — a broken bundle can't ship the variant the updater will hand to `perform_swap`.
3. **Three zips, exact suffixes** — `*-win64.zip`, `*-win64-with-browser.zip`, `*-batch-source.zip`. `_asset_info_from_release`'s `-{want}.zip` match and `current_variant()` depend on these exact suffixes.
4. **One `<asset>.sha256` per zip** (`release.yml:82–92`): sha256sum format `"<hash>  <name>"`, **`-Encoding ascii` (no BOM — a BOM would corrupt the hash)**. This is exactly what `_expected_sha256` parses (first whitespace token, `[0-9a-f]{64}`).
5. **`gh release create` publishes all six assets** — 3 zips + 3 `.sha256`. The workflow FAILS (never skips) if any zip or `.sha256` is missing (P10 per-variant gate). If a `.sha256` were ever dropped, the updater falls back to the GitHub API `digest`; if that's absent too, the install **fails closed** (no size-only fallback).

> **Coupling to remember:** `Compress-Archive -Path "dist\TSMIS Exporter"` is what wraps the bundle in one top-level folder, which is exactly what `_bundle_root` unwraps. If the zip layout ever changes (e.g. a different archiver that doesn't wrap), `_bundle_root` must change with it.

---

## 12. Extension points

**Add a new top-level item to the installed bundle** (a sibling file/folder next to the exe that updates should carry, e.g. a new `Read Me.pdf` or a config template):
- Add its name to `_BUNDLE_ITEMS` (`updater.py:82`). That one tuple is the allowlist for **both** `perform_swap` (what gets copied+swapped) **and** `cleanup_leftovers` (which `.old`/`.new` it removes). An item not in the list is logged-and-ignored during a swap and never cleaned up. (`IT-README.txt` was added this way — it rides updates so a content edit in `build/it_readme.txt` propagates.)
- It must actually ship inside the zip's top-level folder (i.e. be in `dist\TSMIS Exporter\`). User data dirs (`data\`, `output\`, `input\`) must **never** be added — they are not in the staged tree and must stay untouched.
- `check_updater.py:_make_tree`/`test_staged_allowlist` assume the four current items; extend the fixture if you change the set.

**Change the release asset naming / variants:** the `-{want}.zip` suffix logic lives only in `_asset_info_from_release`, and the variant probe only in `current_variant()`. Keep both in lockstep with `release.yml`'s zip names.

**Add update state to the UI:** the worker→GUI protocol is a single `("update_status", dict)` message with a `phase` field; add new phases by extending `UpdateWorker.run`'s posts and `gui_api._on_update_status`'s branches. The dict is the GUI's whole update state — keep `_info` out of anything serialized to JS (it's popped in `_on_update_status`, L729).

**A different verification source:** `_expected_sha256` is the single place trust is established; its two-tier (companion `.sha256` → API `digest`) order is all here, and when both are absent the install **fails closed** (no size-only fallback). Code-signing would slot in as a *new* check alongside (not replacing) it.

---

## 13. Gotchas a maintainer will trip on

- **Swap mode must stay the first thing in `gui_main.main`.** Anything that resolves a path via `paths.py` (logging, config, the CLR) before the `SWAP_FLAG` branch would aim at the *staged* tree, not the install. Don't move `import logging_setup`/`setup_logging` above it, and don't let any import at module top trigger `paths.py` work that the swap process shouldn't do.
- **No PowerShell / cmd / scripts / admin / scheduled tasks anywhere in the swap.** This is a hard constraint from locked-down Caltrans PCs (the v0.9.0 PowerShell helper was silently killed → nothing swapped). The design's only requirement is "exes run from user-writable folders". A change that reaches for any of those will silently fail on the work PC. See [../it-and-security.md](../it-and-security.md).
- **Fail-closed when no checksum (P10).** If both the `.sha256` companion and the API `digest` are absent, `download_and_stage` **aborts the install** (deletes the zip, raises `UpdateError`, shows the release page) — it does NOT proceed on byte count. The old size-only fallback was removed. `release.yml` enforces `.sha256` publication (fails-not-skips), so the verified path is the normal path; the fail-closed branch only triggers on a genuinely checksum-less release.
- **`os._exit` in swap mode.** `run_swap_mode`/`perform_swap` finish with `os._exit` — **no** atexit handlers, no flush of the `tsmis.update` logger (which isn't even set up here). All swap-side logging is the manual `_swap_log` appends; don't expect normal logging to appear in swap mode.
- **Leftovers are cleaned by the *next* app, not the swap.** `perform_swap` cannot delete the `.old` tree (Defender may hold the just-renamed `_internal.old`) or the `staged` tree it runs from. If you add a step expecting them gone immediately, you'll be wrong — they're removed at the relaunched app's `cleanup_leftovers()`.
- **`asset_size == 0` disables two guards.** When the API omits `size`, the disk-space check (`if info.asset_size:`) and the completeness check (`if info.asset_size and done != info.asset_size`) both no-op. The download still verifies via SHA-256 (when available) and via a valid-zip extract, so it's not unguarded — but don't assume `asset_size` is always present.
- **`_clear_webview_caches` is frozen-only (P10).** It sits **below** the `is_frozen()` gate in `cleanup_leftovers`, so a dev run (which serves `scripts/ui` live) does NOT clear it. Only `_recover_store_promotions()` runs before the gate, on every launch.
- **Readiness-marker retries are bounded and fail closed.** A transient marker-access error can recover when the exact nonce becomes readable within 15 s. Any access error permanently disables legacy-log downgrade for that launch; persistent unreadability reaches the deadline, terminates the helper, and leaves the old app running. This prevents a current nonce-capable helper's ordinary log line from masquerading as readiness.
