# TSMIS Exporter — IT / Security review notes

What this doc covers: the plain-language IT/endpoint-security/DLP reference (network
connections, files, browser flags, MOTW, the updater, known gaps, the code-signing
path) **plus** the security threat model — the managed-work-PC capability model the
whole app design is constrained by, the read-only audit's headline findings, the
"don't re-flag, they're good" designs, and the open security gaps.

Audience: the person approving the unsigned `.exe` on a managed Caltrans PC, and any
future agent reasoning about what the app is *allowed* to do on that PC.

Related docs: full updater swap-mode / MOTW / SHA-256 / revert mechanics live in
[build-and-release.md](build-and-release.md); auth-file handling and the sign-in
flow live in [auth-and-signin.md](auth-and-signin.md); the audit prompt / review
methodology lives in [code-review-prompt.md](code-review-prompt.md).

**Shipped handout:** a plain-language, distribution-facing summary of §1–§7 ships
in the app bundle as `IT-README.txt` (source: `build/it_readme.txt`, wired in by
`build.ps1`) — the page to hand an external IT/security reviewer who "raises an
eyebrow" at the app. This file stays the candid *internal* source of truth (it
keeps the audit findings and threat model); keep the two in sync when §1–§7
change. The handout omits the §8 audit P-codes / threat model on purpose.

## 1. Network connections it makes

| Destination | When | Why | Auth |
|---|---|---|---|
| `tsmis.dot.ca.gov` (or the per-env host; a Settings override is restricted to `*.ca.gov`) | Every export / sign-in / env check | Load the TSMIS report page and pull report data (the page itself fetches from a Caltrans intranet ArcGIS host) | The user's Caltrans SSO session |
| The Caltrans ArcGIS **portal / Azure AD IdP** (the page's `CONFIG.oauthAuthorizeUrl` host) | During sign-in only | Standard OAuth/SAML sign-in; the access token comes back in the URL fragment and lives only in page memory (~120 min) | Caltrans SSO / Windows device account |
| `api.github.com` + GitHub's release-asset CDN (a `*.githubusercontent.com` host, resolved at download time) | The one-click **update check** (launch + when the version chip is clicked) and download | Read the latest release tag; download the update zip + its `.sha256` | None — public repo, read-only |
| Playwright's Chromium CDN | **Only** the `.bat` first-time setup, or the optional Settings ▸ "Download Built-in Chromium" | Fetch the bundled-browser binary | None |
| The TSMIS ArcGIS feature service (`rhapps-prod.dot.ca.gov/server/rest/services/TSMIS/lrs_tsmis/FeatureServer`) | **Only** ArcGIS ▸ Layers ▸ Refresh / Check ArcGIS Pro (v0.46.0) | Read the TSMIS layers' attribute tables — made by **ArcGIS Pro's own Python** (a separate process, below), not by the app | The user's ArcGIS Pro sign-in (its own credential store; the app never sees or stores it) |

It makes **no other outbound connections** — no analytics, no telemetry, no
crash-reporting service, no license server. The default `win64` build does not
download a browser at all (it drives the machine's existing Edge/Chrome).

**The one other program it starts (v0.46.0).** ArcGIS ▸ Layers runs
`arcgis_worker\export_layers.py` (a plain Python file inside the app's
`_internal\arcgis_worker\`) with **ArcGIS Pro's own** `python.exe`
(`…\ArcGIS\Pro\bin\Python\envs\arcgispro-py3\python.exe`, found through ArcGIS
Pro's `SOFTWARE\ESRI\ArcGISPro\InstallDir` registry value, or chosen by the user).
It is launched directly as an argument list — never through `cmd`/PowerShell — with
no console window, a clean environment (the app's own `PYTHON*` variables removed)
and no bytecode written into ArcGIS Pro's folder; it only reads layers and writes
Excel files into the app's `arcgis_layers\_refresh\staging` folder, and the app
stops it on Cancel or when it exceeds its time limits. Nothing is installed into
ArcGIS Pro's environment. The TSMIS Project Inspector uses the same pattern on the
same PCs.

**It also starts copies of itself (2026-11-12).** A comparison, TSN consolidation or
ArcGIS report build now runs in a **worker process**: the app's own `.exe` started a
second time by Python's `multiprocessing` (the command line carries
`--multiprocessing-fork` and a pipe handle), so the heavy work stops competing with
the window. It is the same signed-or-unsigned binary from the same folder — no
script, no shell, no temp executable, no elevation, no network of its own — it
reads and writes exactly the files the job did before, talks to the window over
local pipes that exist only on this PC (Python's own: an anonymous pipe at start-up,
then a single-instance named pipe, `\\.\pipe\pyc-…`), and exits when the job ends or
the window closes. One runs at a
time. If the PC refuses to create the process, or the child does not report in
within 90 seconds, the job runs inside the app as it did before and the log says so
(`worker processes disabled for this session: …`); `TSMIS_INPROCESS_WORKERS=1`
forces that. `--self-test` reports which of the two a machine does (`worker
process: started …` or `skipped, this environment refuses child processes`).

TLS for the update check/download uses the **Windows certificate store**
(`ssl.create_default_context()` in `scripts/updater.py`), so corporate TLS
inspection and the system proxy work without any bundled CA list. Do **not** switch
this to `requests`/`certifi` — a bundled CA list would reject a TLS-inspection
re-signed certificate and break the updater on exactly the managed PCs that need it.

## 2. Files it reads and writes

App-private data defaults **next to the `.exe`** (or `%LOCALAPPDATA%\TSMIS Exporter` if
that folder is read-only — see `scripts/paths.py`, `_resolve_data_root` → `DATA_ROOT`).
User-authorized exceptions may live elsewhere: the configured Export-Everything
destination and its comparisons, an explicit TSN workbook selected for reading, and
workbooks/ZIPs chosen in native Save dialogs. The app does not write to system
locations, the registry, or other users' profiles.

- `output\…` — the exported PDF/XLSX reports and run-report CSVs (`OUTPUT_ROOT`).
- `input\tsn_highway_log\…` — TSN PDFs the user drops in (consolidate feature;
  `INPUT_ROOT`).
- `data\` (the app-private `_PRIVATE` tree) — the app's own data: `logs\` (rotating
  diagnostics, `LOG_DIR`), `config.json` (settings, `CONFIG_FILE`), the WebView2
  profile (`WEBVIEW_PROFILE_DIR` = `data\webview2`), the Edge sign-in profile
  (`EDGE_LOGIN_PROFILE_DIR` = `data\edge_login_profile`), the downloaded Chromium if
  any (`DOWNLOADED_BROWSERS_DIR` = `data\ms-playwright`), `update\`
  (`UPDATE_DIR`, staging during an update), and `cache\` (`CACHE_DIR`: two small JSON
  files, `digests.json` and `comparison_headlines.json` — the SHA-256 of files the
  app has already hashed and the counts of comparisons it has already read, each
  keyed to the file's path, size, timestamps and NTFS change stamp. No report
  content. Safe to delete at any time; the app rebuilds it by reading the files
  again).
- `scripts\tsmis_auth.json` (dev) / `data\tsmis_auth.json` (packaged) — the saved
  sign-in session (`AUTH`). **Treat as a credential.** Plaintext Playwright
  `storage_state` (cookies); see §6.
- `data\logs\failures\` (`FAILURES_DIR`) — best-effort screenshots + page HTML when
  a route or sign-in fails, for diagnosis. May contain report data; it is **never**
  added to the shareable support bundle.

(In a frozen build `AUTH`, `LOG_DIR`, `CONFIG_FILE`, etc. all sit under
`DATA_ROOT\data`; in a dev run `_PRIVATE` is the repo root and `AUTH` is
`scripts/tsmis_auth.json`, so the `.bat` workflow is unchanged.)

## 3. Browser flags it sets (and why)

These are the only non-default low-level options, all on automated browser contexts
(defined in `scripts/common.py`):

- **Local Network Access (LNA)** — `_LNA_ARGS`:
  `--disable-features=LocalNetworkAccessChecksWarnings`,
  `--enable-features=LocalNetworkAccessChecks`, plus a pre-granted
  `local-network-access` permission (`_new_app_context`, and the headed-login and
  device-sign-in contexts via `LOGIN_BROWSER_ARGS = _LNA_ARGS`). The TSMIS page
  pulls report data from a Caltrans **intranet** host; Chromium's LNA gate would
  otherwise block that behind an "allow access to your local network?" prompt that
  nothing can click in a headless run. This grants that one permission to the app's
  own automated pages — it does not scan or expose the local network.
- **A loopback CDP debug port** (`--remote-debugging-port=<ephemeral>` on
  `127.0.0.1`, via `_free_local_port()` in `launch_edge_login_context`): used
  **only** during the headed Microsoft Edge
  sign-in flow, so the app can recapture the session if managed Edge relaunches
  itself into a work profile mid-login (returned as `http://127.0.0.1:<port>` for a
  CDP re-attach). The port is a free local port, bound to loopback, and only open
  while that one sign-in window is up. No remote access.
- **The window's own page server** (`127.0.0.1:42001`, pywebview's default
  port): the app's interface is plain files served to its own WebView2 from a
  small HTTP server inside the process, bound to loopback, for as long as the
  window is open. The IT notes that ship beside the exe said "no inbound network
  service" with only the sign-in port as an exception until 2026-11-13; they name
  both now, and `check_shipped_readmes` holds that. A fixed port also means two
  copies of the app would ask for the same one — see [roadmap.md](roadmap.md) J4.

## 4. Mark-of-the-Web (MOTW) handling

When a release zip is downloaded and extracted **without** right-click → Unblock,
Windows tags every file with an NTFS `Zone.Identifier` stream, and the .NET
Framework then refuses to load the bundled WebView2/pythonnet assemblies — the
window dies at startup. On launch the app removes that stream from **only its own
bundled .NET trees** (`_internal\pythonnet`, `_internal\clr_loader`,
`_internal\webview`), which is exactly what right-click → Properties → Unblock does,
scoped to the app's own folder. It does **not** touch user files, system files, or
anything outside the program folder, and it is best-effort (a read-only install just
shows a message explaining the manual Unblock). In-app updates write the zip bytes
directly (no browser), so they never carry MOTW in the first place. Full MOTW/CLR
narrative: [lessons.md](lessons.md); the strip routine itself is
`gui_main._unblock_dotnet_assemblies()` (see [build-and-release.md](build-and-release.md)).

## 5. The one-click updater

(Mechanics summary — full swap-mode / two-phase / revert detail is in
[build-and-release.md](build-and-release.md).)

- Checks `…/releases/latest` (full releases only — never prereleases/drafts).
- Downloads the variant-matching zip into `data\update\` and **verifies its SHA-256**
  against the published `<asset>.sha256` (and the GitHub API's asset digest) before
  extracting. A mismatch refuses the install.
- Installs by COPY-then-RENAME of **only the known bundle items** (`TSMIS
  Exporter.exe`, `_internal`, `Start Here.txt`, `IT-README.txt`) — an unexpected
  staged file is ignored. User data (`output\`, `input\`, `data\`) is never in the update and is
  never touched. A failed swap rolls back to the previous version.
- A read-only install can't self-update; it opens the release page instead.
- Build-time dependencies are hash-pinned in `requirements-build.lock.txt` and
  `build.ps1` installs them with `--require-hashes`; CI also runs `pip-audit`.

## 6. Known gaps (honest disclosure)

- **The published `.exe` is not trust-signed yet.** This is the single biggest
  remaining item — see §7. A **SignPath Foundation** certificate (free for open
  source) has been **applied for**; `build.ps1 -Sign` can self-sign for local/test
  use in the meantime, and `release.yml` already has a gated SignPath step ready to
  switch on. Until a trusted signature ships, SmartScreen may warn on first run and
  EDR/AV may treat the self-updating exe with suspicion (the audit's
  `IT-UNSIGNED-SELF-MODIFY-EDR` finding; signing calms it).
- **The saved session file is plaintext** (`storage_state` cookies, written by
  `common.save_auth_state`), protected only by NTFS file permissions in the user's
  own app folder. Windows DPAPI (`CryptProtectData`) at-rest encryption is the
  candidate hardening (the code comment at `common.save_auth_state` points back at
  this doc).

## 7. Code-signing — the recommended path

Signing the executable (and the bundled native DLLs) with an Authenticode
certificate is the highest-leverage fix: it establishes updater trust, calms EDR
heuristics about a self-replacing exe, and earns SmartScreen reputation — all at
once. Current state and remaining steps:

1. **Certificate.** Obtain a broadly-trusted Authenticode certificate. An OV/EV
   cert needs a registered org (EV gives immediate SmartScreen reputation); for
   this open-source project a free **SignPath Foundation** certificate has been
   **applied for** — that is the intended source. *Interim:* `build.ps1 -Sign`
   self-signs the built exe (SHA-256 + timestamp) for local/test machines and to
   exercise the toolchain — other PCs do **not** trust it unless the cert is
   imported into Trusted Root, so it is not for published releases.
2. **CI signing.** `release.yml` already carries a **gated SignPath step** (the
   `actions/upload-artifact` + `signpath/github-action-submit-signing-request`
   pair). It is inert until the repo variable `SIGNPATH_ENABLED=true` and the
   `SIGNPATH_API_TOKEN` secret / `SIGNPATH_ORG_ID` + policy slug are set — so
   builds still work for contributors without the cert. Flip it on once SignPath
   approves (and add an analogous pair for the with-browser zip).
3. **Updater enforcement.** Once releases are signed, enable **signature
   verification in the updater** (verify the staged exe's Authenticode signature +
   expected publisher before the swap, in addition to the SHA-256 check) and switch
   the requirement on.

The SHA-256 verification and staged-item allowlist already shipped (§5) are the
checksum/integrity half of this; the signature half needs the certificate.

## 8. Constraints & threat model

This section is the reasoning backdrop for everything above: what the work PC *can*
run, what's been independently audited as sound, and what's still open.

### 8.1 Two machines, very different capabilities

| | **Work PC** (the real users) | **Dev / personal PC** (where coding happens) |
|---|---|---|
| Who | Caltrans staff on locked-down managed PCs | The maintainer's personal Windows 11 PC |
| PowerShell | **Blocked entirely** — standard users can't even open it | Available, no limits |
| cmd | No guarantee it works | Available |
| Admin rights | None | Yes |
| TSMIS intranet | **Reachable** (live exports happen here) | **Not reachable** — cannot hit the report site at all |
| Managed-PC controls (Defender / DLP / corporate proxy / managed Edge) | Present and active | **Absent** |
| **Long paths** (`LongPathsEnabled`) | **0 — off, and the user cannot change it.** A path at or past 260 chars simply fails | Commonly **1** (on), so 260+ paths work silently |
| Proven capability | "Unsigned exes run from user-writable folders" (the app itself proves this) | Everything |

> **The long-path row cost a field release (v0.27.0, 2026-07-21).** A content-addressed
> sidecar with a ~148-character basename made a 265-character path at the real install
> depth. Comparisons built, then vanished from the Matrix, because only the trust
> metadata failed to write. The dev box had long paths ON, so nothing local could
> reproduce it — and the one check that might have has since been made unconditional.
> **Any new persisted filename is a path-budget decision.** `--collect-evidence` now
> reports this registry value and a full path-length census, so the next instance is one
> bundle away instead of one field report away (lesson 14 in
> [lessons.md](lessons.md)).

**Hard rule for any work-PC feature.** Anything that must run *on the work PC*
(updates, helpers, "scheduled anything") must work as a plain `.exe` invocation from
a user-writable folder — **no PowerShell, no cmd scripts, no temp script files, no
elevation, no scheduled tasks.** This is not a preference; it is the only capability
proven to exist there.

> **Why this rule exists (field failure, 2026-06-12).** The v0.9.0 updater shipped a
> PowerShell swap helper. On the work PC it **died silently** — the update downloaded
> and staged, the app closed, and nothing installed (PowerShell is blocked for
> standard users). Fixed in **v0.10.1** by making the staged exe apply itself
> (`updater.run_swap_mode`), which needs only "exes run from user folders." The full
> narrative is in [lessons.md](lessons.md).

**Why testing is asymmetric — and what that means for security work.** Live-site
verification can only happen on the work PC, because the personal dev PC can't reach
the TSMIS intranet. Crucially, the managed-PC security controls (Defender, DLP, the
corporate proxy, managed-Edge behavior) exist on **neither** the personal dev PC nor
any cloud CI runner. So **IT / DLP / endpoint behavior can only be reasoned about
from code — it can never be empirically tested off the work PC.** Treat every claim
in §1–§7 about how Defender/DLP/proxy/managed Edge will react as a code-derived
hypothesis, not a tested fact, and design conservatively. (Related context for
diagnosing field reports: a problem report almost always means the *work* PC — see
[lessons.md](lessons.md).)

The work PC's proxy/TLS-inspection setup is exactly why the updater trusts the
**Windows cert store** (§1) and the DLP scanner is exactly why `prune_bundle.ps1`
strips DLP-blocked content from the bundle (the Playwright docs once shipped a test
credit-card number that corporate DLP blocks — see
[build-and-release.md](build-and-release.md)).

Since **v0.21.0** the bundle also carries **Pillow + pypdfium2** (`pdfium.dll`, the
PDF rasterizer behind the evidence images) — an unsigned in-folder native DLL like
the pythonnet/WebView2 loaders the app already ships, loaded from `_internal\` with
no elevation, no temp-script, no new network behavior. Work-PC hypothesis (untested
until a field run): Defender treats it like the other bundled DLLs. If a managed PC
ever blocks it, only the evidence option degrades — exports/comparisons are
unaffected (the imports are lazy).

### 8.2 Read-only audit, 2026-06-15 (v0.10.4 / SHA `0643fe2`)

A ruthless read-only audit (7-domain subagent fan-out + lead re-verification) was run
against v0.10.4 code (byte-identical to release tag `v0.10.4`). Full report lived at
`code-review/AUDIT-claude-0643fe2.md` (gitignored). The methodology/prompt is in
[code-review-prompt.md](code-review-prompt.md). Headline findings the maintainer
should act on (all verified against code, not just asserted):

- **P0 `AUTH-TOKEN-IN-LOG-BUNDLE`** — at audit time `common.auth_state()` logged the
  raw `page.url` (the OAuth token rides in the URL hash) to `tsmis.log` on every
  navigate, and `gui_api.save_support_bundle` zips `tsmis.log*` as "safe to share."
  `page_url_for_display` stripped the fragment for the *screen* but the *log* path
  did not. **Status in current code: addressed** — `common.auth_state` now routes the
  URL through `page_url_for_display` (which `_replace(fragment="")`), so the token can
  reach neither a log line nor a failure dump. See discrepancy note (the memory
  snapshot predates the fix).
- **P1 `AUTH-WRONG-ENV-SILENT-SUCCESS`** — `navigate_with_auth`'s
  `if _site_params_ok(page) or reloaded_for_params:` accepts a still-wrong env after
  one reload; the run folder is labeled by selection, with no post-success CONFIG
  recheck. (Auth/env mechanics: [auth-and-signin.md](auth-and-signin.md).)
- **P1 `UPDATER-NO-SIGNATURE-VERIFY`** + `RELEASE-NO-DIGEST-OR-SIGN` — the updater
  extracts and runs an unsigned exe; it trusts the Windows cert store including
  TLS-inspection roots. Code-signing is the single highest-leverage fix (also clears
  the EDR-look finding `IT-UNSIGNED-SELF-MODIFY-EDR`). The SHA-256 digest + checksum
  publishing half shipped after the audit (§5); the signature half is still open
  (§6/§7).
- **P1 `SHEET-COMPARE-SYMMETRIC-SKIP-MATCH`** — `compare_env._load_xlsx_side`
  silently drops a route unreadable on **both** sides, so a verdict could still say
  "EVERYTHING MATCHES." (The v0.11.0 incompleteness contract — `⚠ COULD NOT COMPARE
  EVERYTHING`, forced `verdict="diff"` on skipped inputs — is the intended fix; see
  [comparison-engine.md](comparison-engine.md).)

### 8.3 Current independently reverified controls

These controls have current executable checks; re-audit them when their boundaries change:

- **GUI is injection-safe.** The Python→JS bridge dispatches via `json.dumps`
  (`window.__tsmis.dispatch()`); `app.js` uses **no `innerHTML` / no `eval`**, so
  report data and env strings can't become markup or code. (GUI internals:
  [gui.md](gui.md).)
- **`reset_targets` (Delete-all-reports) is identity- and ownership-bound.** Logs,
  the saved login, browser profiles, and settings are never candidates. A child of a
  user-chosen Export-Everything destination is eligible only when its name/layout,
  purpose-specific create-only ownership marker, direct-parent relationship, and stable
  directory identity all agree; older markers, user-created folders, linked paths, and
  ambiguous entries are retained with a preview warning. The preview captures the exact
  entry/root identities and the GUI binds that immutable set to a single-use confirmation
  token. Reset then atomically renames each approved entry to an unpredictable same-parent
  quarantine, revalidates the identity/marker, and uses the reparse-safe deleter. A failed
  deletion is restored or retained at the disclosed quarantine path; an object that later
  appears under the original name is never inherited into the approved set. User-placed
  TSN inputs remain an explicit opt-in exception: they have no app-ownership marker, but
  the preview and quarantine still bind their exact identities. Locked by
  `check_owned_dir.py`, `check_reset_safety.py`, `check_b3_batch.py`, and the GUI token tests.
- **Generated writes stay under exact app-created leases.** External store roots are
  create-only and purpose-marked; pre-existing/legacy folders are never adopted.
  `OwnershipLease` rejects a replaced root or any linked descendant. Exclusive staging,
  report saves, consolidation/PDF scratch, sidecars/caches/evidence, promotion journals,
  recovery, and cleanup all receive target-aware guards and bind created-object identities.
  `check_owned_dir.py`, `check_artifact_store.py`, and `check_matrix_ownership.py` execute
  ordinary replacement plus real Windows junction cases.
- **The support bundle excludes the auth file and browser profiles.**
  `gui_api.save_support_bundle` adds only the rotating logs (`tsmis.log*`,
  `crash.log`, `update_helper.log`), up to 50 recent run-report CSVs, and a
  `manifest.txt`; that manifest includes only the diagnostic settings explicitly
  allowlisted by `settings.support_bundle_settings()`. Its own docstring + the
  user-facing message say it carries "this
  PC's name in paths" so it's "safe to send to the TSMIS maintainer, not safe to post
  publicly" — and **never** the saved login, profiles, or `FAILURES_DIR` dumps.
- **Validation evidence is credential-scanned at the final ZIP boundary.** Diagnostic
  text is redacted through the shared credential grammar, then every final member is
  scanned before publication — member names/comments/extra fields, UTF-8/UTF-16 and
  binary streams, and nested Office/ZIP members included. An opaque or malformed Office
  member that cannot be proved safe fails closed. Publication is atomic, so a rejected
  build leaves the prior good evidence bundle byte-for-byte intact. Locked by
  `check_evidence_bundle.py` and `check_validation.py`.
- **The website-source capture is local-only diagnostic data** (v0.26.0,
  Settings ▸ "Capture website source" → `site_capture.py`; made exhaustive
  2026-09-02). It saves the current site's report page (`index.html` + the
  rendered DOM) and EVERY same-origin file the page uses — what the DOM loaded
  plus every relative file name found in the page and inside each fetched file,
  followed to a fixpoint (the `document.write`'d report modules, `config.js`,
  `debug.js`, images, referenced notes) — into `output/site-capture/<date src-env
  host-site HHMMSS>/` (the dev or main site, v0.49.0) under the files' own site names,
  with a manifest (BUILD_DATE, CONFIG
  env/src, a SHA-256 per file, the third-party URLs it saw), so the folder is
  handed over as-is. It deliberately writes NO archive: `evidence.py` is the one
  module in the app that builds a zip (`check_evidence_bundle` pins that), and an
  archive of Caltrans-internal source is exactly what a second writer must not
  produce. The TSMIS source is **Caltrans-internal**: the capture stays on disk
  (the manifest says so in-band), is never added to the support bundle or
  uploaded, and third-party URLs are never fetched (a file cap bounds the
  reference walk). Filenames are sanitized and
  traversal-proof (`_clean_name`, falling back to the flattened `_safe_name` on a
  collision; locked by `check_site_capture.py`). Runs on whatever sign-in the
  exports use; no new permissions, no endpoints beyond the TSMIS page itself.
- **Settings writes are atomic.** `config.json` (and the batch manifest,
  `batch_manifest.save` → temp file + `os.replace`) are written atomically, so a
  crash mid-write can't corrupt them.
- **Reset never recursively follows a junction/symlink.** `safe_delete.scoped_rmtree`
  inspects entries without following them and unlinks a reparse entry itself; the
  identity-bound quarantine above prevents a replacement at the previewed spelling from
  transferring delete authority. This guarantee is enforced by real Windows junction
  probes, rather than depending on undocumented `shutil.rmtree` behavior. The updater's
  staged ZIP is separately SHA-256-verified and its extraction path checks reject
  traversal/absolute/drive escapes. The unavoidable last-instruction pathname race of
  ordinary Windows rename/delete APIs remains minimized by immediate identity rechecks
  and fail-closed retention; native handle-relative filesystem calls would be required
  to remove that final syscall-sized window entirely.

### 8.4 Open security gaps (the levers that remain)

In priority order:

1. **Code-signing the `.exe`** — the one big remaining lever. Fixes updater trust,
   EDR heuristics, and SmartScreen at once (§7).
2. **Auth file at rest is plaintext `storage_state`** — protected only by NTFS perms.
   Consider Windows DPAPI (`CryptProtectData`) encryption (§6; see
   [auth-and-signin.md](auth-and-signin.md) for the auth lifecycle).

*Questions: see the rotating logs (`data\logs\tsmis.log`) and the "Save support
bundle" button, which packages logs + settings (and this PC's name in paths) for the
maintainer — never the saved login.*
