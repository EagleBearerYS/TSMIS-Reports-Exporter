# Comparison real-data canary bindings

Last updated: 2026-07-14  
Corpus root: `C:\Users\Yunus\Downloads\TSMIS` (local only; never copy corpus members into the repository)  
Purpose: bind the exact real bytes used to approve comparison behavior before any
semantic re-bless

The oracle / gate identities below are those of the files on the day each section was
written. Two later edits changed files named here, so their current hashes differ:
`build/phase8_ramp_summary_comparison.py` on 2026-08-18, and on 2026-11-13 both Stage-8
summary oracles and their gates, which now match the cover page's submitter by its shape
and require one submitter across the pull. On the bound 7.9 PDFs the edited oracles read
every route, count and provenance digest unchanged.

## Trust policy

- Read the corpus `_INDEX.md` for routing, but do not treat the index, an agent report,
  or a historical comparison workbook as identity proof.
- `ground-truth/` is the acceptance source. `report-samples/` is for parser spot checks,
  `comparison-outputs/` is historical reference only, and `_scratch/` is never an oracle.
- Hash only the selected files or an exact selected member manifest. Do not crawl or
  hash the entire approximately 5.8 GB corpus.
- A changed expected count is a stop condition until exact source identity, code/
  producer versions, and the cell-level delta explain it.

Binding states:

- `baseline-bound`: exact inputs and current code identity are recorded; typed values/
  formulas output and real-Excel recalculation agree with the approved result.
- `input-bound`: exact source files, roles, lengths, and SHA-256 values are recorded;
  pre-change output/code identity is still pending.
- `provisional`: the bundle and expected result are named, but its exact member manifest
  and digest are not yet recorded.
- `blocked`: the available material cannot yet support an unambiguous acceptance result.

## First bound canary — Highway Log Route 1

Canary ID: `HL-R1-E1`  
Flavor: per-route TSMIS Excel versus TSN Excel  
Stable recipe family: Highway Log vs TSN  
Binding state: `baseline-bound`  
Expected approved result: 299 paired / 18 TSMIS-only / 69 TSN-only /
221 differing rows / 969 differing cells

| Role | Exact file | Length | Last write UTC (informational) | SHA-256 |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| TSMIS | `C:\Users\Yunus\Downloads\TSMIS\ground-truth\inputs\tsmis_highway_log_route 1.xlsx` | 350,655 | 2026-06-11 16:32:57 | `34787055E8710CB656D0C016FD2290F222897089305097F072F146E78F2F15E2` |
| TSN | `C:\Users\Yunus\Downloads\TSMIS\ground-truth\inputs\tsn_highway_log_route 1.xlsx` | 44,299 | 2026-06-16 22:46:21 | `93DA8DF0FF0C147E3456B889A8525C52B04871368AFFD2AAA893C09C02AD3303` |

The timestamps are not trusted identity; SHA-256 and exact role/path are.

### Pre-Phase-3 baseline run — 2026-07-11

- Git base: `0430b4259b86124494729fcd79b4b084aa3ebaed`; the worktree was intentionally
  dirty with the audited Phase-1/2 changes and is not represented by that commit alone.
- Working source manifest: 124 files (`scripts/**/*.py` plus `version.py`), sorted as
  `relative/path|file_sha256` and joined with LF; manifest SHA-256
  `0f89f2dd933917cc839ff54a093f6ecf4f6cd647eb386f95603e635a4907764a`.
- The real comparator ran in `mode="both"` and strict-read one committed generation
  containing values plus formulas. Typed result: complete/diff; 299 paired; 18/69
  one-sided; 221 differing rows; 78 identical paired rows; 969 differing cells;
  8,970 asserted cells.
- Values workbook: 207,665 bytes; SHA-256
  `85dc68bd1def2e0653a0875f7bf8fc7d0e2134485c0df4f58b640344abd9f04c`.
- Formulas workbook before Excel: 743,789 bytes; SHA-256
  `9844c25f8c63bf829a95959f082b404c45dfbae0fd715972842762e0aef2d5bb`.
- Installed Excel ran invisible `CalculateFullRebuild` on a copy. Recalculated copy:
  931,099 bytes; SHA-256
  `F6E36E2D72E7F30431A936935778A4561D4BDC175A21933BFCFED839E8D7382B`.
- Live formulas and values Summary agreed exactly at 299 paired, 18/69 one-sided,
  221 differing, 78 identical, and 969 differing cells. All six Summary SELF-CHECK
  rows and all 30 Spot Check `Agree?` rows read `OK`.
- Both input files were SHA-256 rechecked after the run and matched the pre-run values
  above. The outputs are temporary evidence; their paths are deliberately not an oracle.

### v5 re-bless — 2026-07-17 (CMP-AUD-157/045-HL: the TSN normalizer v5 gate)

The HL vs-TSN loaders now REFUSE a pre-v5 TSN workbook (no "TSN Normalization"
marker sheet), so the frozen TSN input above can no longer feed the comparator —
by design, not by accident. The re-blessed TSN input was built from the live
library's `D01 Highway Log TSN.pdf` with the v5 module and the production
per-route writer:

| Role | Exact file | Length | SHA-256 |
|---|---|---:|---|
| TSN (v5) | `C:\Users\Yunus\Downloads\TSMIS\ground-truth\inputs\tsn_highway_log_route 1 v5.xlsx` | 49,648 | `531F10887BC7EC714E7C993B05AC5A146478F614D964163715CCBFCD679E668D` |

- The v5 file's DATA ROWS are exactly the frozen input's rows (tuple-for-tuple;
  D01 route 001 has no suffixed section and no asterisk-leading description, so
  v5 moves nothing there). Workbook BYTES differ run-to-run (openpyxl docProps
  timestamps + the added marker/legend sheets); the SHA above binds the exact
  filed artifact, and the rows are the oracle.
- The real comparator (frozen TSMIS input vs the v5 TSN input, `mode="both"`)
  reproduced the locked result EXACTLY: typed complete/diff, 299 paired,
  18/69 one-sided, 221 differing rows, 78 identical, 969 differing cells,
  8,970 asserted — and every one of the 30 per-field counts is identical to
  the pre-Phase-3 baseline table. Both frozen inputs were SHA-256 rechecked
  after the run and unchanged.
- Harness: session 119c7c70 scratchpad `route1_canary_v5.py`.

### HL statewide v5 measured reference — 2026-07-17 (diagnostic, NOT a canary)

TSMIS = `All Reports 7.9\2026-07-09 ssor-prod\consolidated\highway_log_consolidated
2026-07-09 ssor-prod.xlsx` (51,884 rows / 252 routes; 284 rows on the ten suffixed
routes); TSN = the v5 normalized consolidated built from the 12 live-library raw
prints (60,083 rows / 273 routes / report date 09/15/25). The ~10-month source
vintage gap makes this a measured reference for future drift comparison — never a
match target. Typed result (values mode, `compare_highway_log.compare`):

- 48,351 paired / 3,533 TSMIS-only / 11,732 TSN-only; 39,623 differing rows
  (140,643 differing cells); 8,728 fully identical; 1,437,881 asserted cells;
  12,649 context (ditto) cells.
- **Every one of the 252 TSMIS routes pairs, including all ten suffixed routes**
  — under v4 the ten suffixed routes were structurally unpairable (their 284
  TSMIS rows read "Only in TSMIS" while TSN's 317 rows inflated the base
  routes). 21 TSN-only routes remain (rows tinted "entire route"), a data-vintage
  fact, honestly one-sided.
- Largest per-field counts (vintage drift): Cnty Odom 21,257 · Sig Chg. Date
  17,914 · MI 9,038 · Med TCB 8,535 · LB ST 6,856 — full table in the session
  transcript; the workbook was temporary evidence.
- Harnesses: scratchpad `statewide_hl_v5_compare.py`; the v5 build via the
  production `consolidate()` (12 documents, 380 per-route members = 369 base +
  the 11 suffixed sections; claims sidecar saved beside the scratch build).
- A read-only D2 token census over 8,736 nonblank TSMIS cells and 10,131 nonblank TSN
  cells found zero Boolean cells, control-whitespace/NBSP strings, Excel-error-token
  strings, literal difference markers, numeric values over 15 significant digits,
  digit strings over 15 digits, or signed/leading-decimal tokens. Lowercase appeared
  only in ten header labels on each side. Route-1 therefore protects ordinary parity
  but cannot decide the controversial D2 edge semantics; synthetic adversarial fixtures
  and affected statewide families remain required.

This is the E1 pre-change baseline. Any equality/formula/count change must rerun the
same bound inputs and source-manifest procedure, then explain every changed cell before
re-blessing.

## Bound Phase-3 gate — current-schema Intersection Detail

Canary ID: `CORE-ID-78-XLSX-TSN`  
Flavor: current 35-column TSMIS Excel versus normalized TSN Excel  
Stable recipe family: Intersection Detail vs TSN  
Binding state: `baseline-bound` — exact member manifest, corrected independent oracle,
current-code production formulas/values generation, schema-v3 payload, and installed-
Excel parity are immutable and independently rehashed

This replaces `CORE-STATEWIDE-619` as the Phase-3 statewide gate. The current
Intersection Detail comparator deliberately refuses the 6.19 TSMIS exports' pre-July
36-column layout, so the historical 6.19 result cannot exercise today's production
loader end to end. The 7.8 bundle uses the accepted 35-column layout and exercises the
shared equality and pairing engine on a real statewide detailed report.

Fixed root aliases and member selectors:

| Role | Root alias | Exact member selector | Required count |
|---|---|---|---:|
| TSMIS Excel (`tsmis_xlsx`) | `id78` = `C:\Users\Yunus\Downloads\TSMIS\ground-truth\Intersection Detail Bundle 7.8` | Direct ordinary-file children of `intersection_detail\` whose names match `^intersection_detail_route_[0-9]{3}[A-Z]?\.xlsx$` | 217 |
| TSN raw Excel (`tsn_xlsx`) | `all619` = `C:\Users\Yunus\Downloads\TSMIS\ground-truth\All Reports 6.19` | Exact file `TSN\Intersection Detail\TSAR - INTERSECTION DETAIL_TSN.xlsx` | 1 |

The independently re-enumerated and content-hashed input manifest has exactly **218
members** and **26,384,760 source bytes**. Its versioned serialization is 31,085 bytes
and has SHA-256
`9d1c0ae4f9bc8de098497695cd87d3c543dba01e34cb9f4b03cb883791b52bd6`.
The audit found 217 matching TSMIS files, zero other direct files, no reparse members,
no duplicate route tokens, and exactly six suffixed tokens: `008U`, `010S`, `014U`,
`058U`, `178S`, and `210U`. Route 170 is absent; that agrees with the subsequently
confirmed current route universe rather than representing a missing file in only one
edition. The exact TSN member is 2,920,705 bytes with SHA-256
`5170ab19b957ba78ab0f175571f3aab51e8c49cac13fa307b3d0beaa023c84a2`.

The independent binding enumeration/content hash was repeated and remained identical.
The binding gate must continue to reject reparse points, non-ordinary files,
case-folded duplicate paths, unexpected direct children, owner-lock files,
selector/count drift, or any input change during the actual comparison run. This
read-only binding pass did not replace the required immediate-pre-run and post-run
content rechecks. Retain the full 218-record manifest with the actual canary run before
promoting this gate to `baseline-bound`; the digest alone binds the current selection
but is not a substitute for that durable per-member record.

Do not include `7.8.zip`, `_verification-scripts\`, the 217 PDF edition files, the TSN
statewide print, a retained consolidated workbook, or a retained normalized library in
this input manifest. Rebuild the TSMIS consolidation and TSN normalized library v3 into
an isolated destination from the selected raw members.

The authored 2026-07-08 production-path run records this provisional expected result:

- TSMIS consolidated: 16,459 rows;
- TSN normalized v3: 16,626 rows / 211 routes;
- 16,199 paired, 260 TSMIS-only, and 427 TSN-only;
- 21,675 differing cells.

Those numbers are now independently established by the corrected oracle below.
The retained `e2e_compare.py` imports production modules and historically counted
difference-marker text. Its companion studies report 16,200 and 16,206 pairings under
different study identities/projections, so neither number may silently replace the
production-path 16,199. Before promotion to `baseline-bound`, a new independent oracle
must implement the approved identity/equality contract without importing the comparison
engine and record the complete typed count vector, including differing rows, identical
paired rows, differing cells, and asserted cells. The TSN print-adapter study also
reported 21 duplicate keys; the binding run must establish which duplicate groups enter
the comparison pairing trace rather than treating that study count as automatic proof.
The approved D2/D3 semantics and the oracle exclusion boundary are recorded in
[`comparison-phase3-decision-gates.md`](comparison-phase3-decision-gates.md).

### Corrected independent oracle — promotable — 2026-07-12

The corrected standalone run completed in 67.242 seconds with the exact raw manifest
unchanged before/after. It established:

- 16,459 TSMIS and 16,626 TSN rows;
- 16,199 paired, 260 TSMIS-only, and 427 TSN-only;
- 16,053 differing rows and 21,675 differing cells;
- 518,368 asserting cells and zero context cells;
- 106 duplicate groups, all exact, none capped; and
- 259 retained route-provenance diagnostics.

**2026-07-17 SITE EDITION — supersedes the 7.8 reference above (legacy kept for
backward compatibility).** The site shipped a new Intersection Detail build
(`ground-truth/Intersection Detail 2026-07-17/`, ssor-prod). Two changes, both
verified: (1) a **LABEL-ONLY** header correction — `P`→`PP`, `S`→`PS`, the INT
Type/INT Eff-Date labels realigned to sit over their own values, `Ctrl T`→`Ctrl T
Eff-Date`, `Xing P/S`→`Int PS` — with EVERY value in the SAME position (proven
cell-for-cell; the by-position loaders are unaffected). `compare_intersection_detail_tsn`
accepts BOTH editions via `exact_consolidated_header_ok(_TSMIS_HEADER,
_TSMIS_HEADER_LEGACY)` (034 gate preserved — junk/shift/wrong-edition still refused).
(2) a real **DATA refresh** — Int St Eff-Date updated from historical dates to the
bulk stamp `22-01-01` on 16,053 rows (aligning with TSN, which stores bulk stamps),
plus HG (682) and PM-suffix (307) edits, and the equate/junction rows normalized
(0 file≠Location rows, down from 259 — CMP-AUD-070 now moot as well as not-a-defect).
Same 217 routes / 16,459 rows. Observed vs-TSN canary on the NEW edition (same TSN
library; the same harness reproduces the 7.8 **21,675** exactly): **16,886 comparison
rows / 5,092 differing cells** (Int St Eff-Date 16,041→104). A full hash-bound
independent-oracle re-bless of the new edition is the follow-up; this observed count,
plus the label-only-header + real-data-refresh proof, is the current binding note.
Harness: session scratchpad `id_new_vs_old_canary.py` / `id_whatchanged.py`.

**2026-09 SITE EDITION — first on the 2026-09-25 ssor-prod pull (the owner's
`2026-09-25 ssor-prod.zip`, filed as `ground-truth/Intersection Detail 2026-09-25/`
with the zip inside: 217 routes in both editions + the work-PC
consolidated workbook).** Every header relabelled AND one real move: the intersecting
route number and its suffix swapped (532/532 route numbers moved from consolidated
position 31 to 30, the 2 suffixes 30 → 31, nothing else moved — censused cell-for-cell
against the 2026-07-23 pull, 16,459 paired rows; 2 new rows). v0.45.0 REFUSED the
edition at the exact-header gate. Now accepted with its own position map
(`_TSMIS_POS_2026_09`). Observed through the shipped entry points against the 6.19 raw
TSN extract: **vs TSN 16,201 paired / 260 TSMIS-only / 425 TSN-only / 5,036 differing
cells** (Intrte Route 0 — the old map would read the suffix and flag 273); control: the
2026-07-23 pull through the same harness reproduces the 2026-07-17 note's **5,092**
exactly. PDF vs Excel **16,461 paired / 0 / 0 / 0 cells**; PDF vs TSN identical to Excel
vs TSN; cross-env 9/25 vs 7/23 **16,459 paired / 2 one-sided / 158 cells**, equal to the
census's own data edits (HG 56, City Code 55, RU 10, 3 rows × 12 ML/CS cells,
Description 1). ArcGIS build (as of 2026-09-25) vs 7/23 and vs 9/25: pairing identical
(15,197), Intrte Route 78 on both.

An independent first/corrected-pass reconciliation proved exactly 142 removed
artifacts and zero additions. Every removal was field `Intrte Postmile`; exactly two
rows became fully equal; four removals occurred inside duplicate groups; trace costs
fell by 142 total; and no assignment or source-pair changed. This is the required
explained re-bless for the Excel-binary64 lexical correction.

### Clean production and installed-Excel canary — accepted — 2026-07-12

The frozen current-code `r3` run completed in 762.424 seconds under
`C:\Users\Yunus\.codex\visualizations\2026\07\10\019f4e12-9bbf-7000-949a-019b80f60bdd\phase3_production\CORE-ID-78-XLSX-TSN-2026-07-12-r3`.
The exact raw manifest remained identical before comparison, after comparison, and
after Excel: 218 members / 26,384,760 bytes / SHA-256
`9d1c0ae4f9bc8de098497695cd87d3c543dba01e34cb9f4b03cb883791b52bd6`.

Production exactly reproduced the corrected independent oracle:

- 16,199 paired rows, 260 TSMIS-only, and 427 TSN-only;
- 16,053 differing rows and 21,675 differing cells;
- 518,368 asserted cells and zero context cells; and
- 106 duplicate traces, all exact, with zero capped groups.

Installed Excel ran invisible full rebuilds on evidence copies. Formula/value parity
covered 16,886 Comparison rows, one typed-state chunk, all 11 Summary self-checks, 56
shared numeric Summary labels, 32 Spot Check fields, 33,087 helper cells, and both
Report Views at exactly 43,350 physical difference rows (`2 × 21,675`).

Schema-v3 publication was complete and exact: generation
`7e992838-e21a-4da0-ac7b-684b71675c87`, one 43,728-byte decoded canonical outcome,
payload SHA-256 `8e47c4791dd0795181f9277f48472cca0a8173d7819ccc67382723df27d30627`,
binding SHA-256 `f8ad0cebecdfc682d390bce3f678c309f5c4421c615e648b9a3825349ea15f75`,
and one 4,702-byte chunk whose SHA-256 is
`844ed56683cde6c355fd518e5b34f0e0c791c8a416801877aa2079748d319cac`.
Both peer sidecars strict-read trusted/current after Excel; no sentinel or Office owner
lock remained. The permanent zero-byte publication lock is separately hashed as the
standard empty SHA-256.

| Evidence member | Bytes | SHA-256 |
|---|---:|---|
| production result JSON | 9,063 | `a54448f621beb27cea4e4b7a82af1b0a65580e84c5eac6df313242959a1111b2` |
| formulas workbook | 57,205,922 | `6289a114a1082bf5c7c2cdac066d9fda69098ac5866da229fd9f5a08090638df` |

The result binds 15 evidence artifacts and 11 production source hashes. A separate
post-run verifier rehashed every artifact/source, strict-read both peers, rechecked the
counts, and confirmed no sentinels/owner locks. The earlier unsuffixed run is retained
as evidence of the corrected uppercase-basename publication defect, and `r2` is an
intentionally aborted code-changing run; neither is an acceptance artifact.

### Independent first pass retained but not promotable — 2026-07-12

The standalone stdlib reader/adapter/oracle completed one fully pre/post-bound pass in
54.6 seconds. The 218-member manifest stayed byte-identical before and after at
`9d1c0ae4f9bc8de098497695cd87d3c543dba01e34cb9f4b03cb883791b52bd6`.
It read 16,459 TSMIS and 16,626 TSN rows and reported:

- 16,199 paired, 260 TSMIS-only, 427 TSN-only;
- 16,055 differing rows;
- 21,817 differing cells across 518,368 asserting cells; zero context cells;
- 106 duplicate groups, all assigned exactly with no cap; and
- 259 route-provenance diagnostics, retaining legitimate cross-route source rows
  without altering the authoritative reader.

Immutable first-pass evidence is retained under
`C:\Users\Yunus\.codex\visualizations\2026\07\10\019f4e12-9bbf-7000-949a-019b80f60bdd\phase3_oracle\CORE-ID-78-XLSX-TSN-2026-07-12-first-pass-decimal-lexical`.
Key hashes are:

| Member | Records/bytes | SHA-256 |
|---|---:|---|
| differences JSONL | 21,817 records / 13,910,698 bytes | `262c204bc54ac9dedee0cdab3f018e7470a3ad16c7e8805b2ac0d9a4bc9f98e1` |
| pairing trace JSONL | 16,106 records / 4,532,544 bytes | `2cd0fc30abd1c6e6bc9e1cbe9ce136b790a7aed3c86cd4731c945954a50f0f00` |
| route provenance JSONL | 259 records / 53,082 bytes | `a45a52211cdd8111e01ae3bd5a2b398a8b1713331460c92a9194fcf40a69087e` |

This pass exposed one oracle-reader seam rather than a source difference: 142 TSN
numeric XML lexicals such as `0.92100000000000004` are Excel binary64 cells whose
display/comparison spelling is `0.921`, exactly matching TSMIS text. All 142 independently
collapse to their TSMIS value under the corrected binary64-shortest-representation
rule; no exception was found. A naive subtraction would yield the provisional 21,675
cells and 16,053 differing rows, but four affected cells occur in duplicate groups, so
those totals were **not** promoted by arithmetic. The separately executed corrected
bound rerun above established them directly and preserved this first-pass directory
unchanged.

## Historical engine evidence — pre-July Intersection Detail

Historical ID: `CORE-STATEWIDE-619-HISTORICAL`  
Acceptance status: historical evidence only; **not a current Phase-3 gate**

The old re-proof used the 218 direct-child pre-July TSMIS workbooks under
`ground-truth\All Reports 6.19\TSMIS\Intersection Detail\` plus the one TSN workbook
named above: 219 raw members. It recorded 2,789,732 output cells identical across the
then-current before/after engine builds, with 163,310 differing cells and 677 one-sided
rows unchanged. Those facts remain useful evidence about the historical engine and
dataset, but current production code explicitly refuses that old 36-column TSMIS shape.
Reproducing it requires a pinned historical loader/code identity and must not be reported
as an end-to-end acceptance result for the current comparator.

## Historical-edition parity gate — Intersection Detail 7.8 PDF vs Excel

Canary ID: `ID-78-PDF-XLSX-L6`  
Owning batch: Stage 9 historical editions, with parser mutations remediated in Phase 4 L6  
Binding state: `provisional` — exact bounded selectors are known; member hashes and a
current typed baseline remain deferred until the historical-edition pass

Use the same 217 `id78\intersection_detail\*.xlsx` members selected above and the 217
direct ordinary-file children of `id78\intersection_detail_pdf\` matching
`^intersection_detail_route_[0-9]{3}[A-Z]?\.pdf$`. The read-only selection audit found
the two 217-token route sets identical. The parity input manifest is therefore exactly
**434 members**; it is deliberately separate from the Phase-3 Excel-vs-TSN manifest.

The retained 7.8 authored raw parity census records 16,459/16,459 rows and 576,065 cells, with 278
raw Description whitespace-collapse mismatches and no non-whitespace differences. The
product-level provisional expectation after `_xl_trim` is 16,459 paired, 0/0 one-sided,
and zero differing cells. This is version-pinned history, not current 7.9 truth: `ID-79`
has the exact nine-cell current delta recorded below. Bind and independently re-prove the
7.8 typed result in Stage 9; do not merge the two editions or their expectations.

## Phase-4 raw TSN normalization witness — source-bound, not promoted

Witness ID: `TSN-RAW-7-2026-07-12-R2`  
Source record:
[comparison-phase4-tsn-source-rebaseline.md](comparison-phase4-tsn-source-rebaseline.md)  
Binding state: exact pre-hardening source/output baseline; isolation/completion green;
blocked from comparison-canary promotion by the fresh post-contract production witness,
independent conservation, and later family-identity integration

The owner's raw-only library binds exactly 29 comparison-truth members / 52,670,235
bytes / canonical manifest
`c6c91c378c4010682df72f000212df26f9ed5caae89ba38bb6c6b226393a7c54`.

`0f2f1edbb7c6eed04b203fdfd4e8941332f55501fae48c6a3daac404f4c3c048`.
The production-path result is

The later r3/r4/r5/r6 directories are partial rejected audit attempts, not witnesses. r5
was stopped during Highway Log when the consumer/publication/runner lifecycle review
found new CMP-AUD-035 gaps; r6 was stopped on normalized-byte certificate inheritance
and post-ensure raw drift. No result record from either attempt was accepted.

### Accepted current-code normalization witness — r7

Witness ID: `TSN-RAW-7-2026-07-12-R7`  
Binding state: `baseline-bound` for the accepted Stage-5 production normalization
lifecycle only; source conservation and family-comparison promotion remain later gates

Every family records `status=ok`, `completion=complete`, zero skipped/failed inputs,
an exact builder certificate, coherent current status, a current canonical normalized
identity token, and immediate certified reuse with unchanged workbook and sidecar. An
independent read-only r2/r7 stream compared all seven workbooks: every sheet name, cell
type, and all 5,547,205 cell values were identical. The different XLSX package hashes are
therefore packaging/provenance changes, not normalized-fact changes.

This witness closes the Stage-5 normalized-generation lifecycle only. Visual evidence
still needs Stage-10 immutable capture and exact manifests for the live TSMIS and TSN PDF
read sets; that separate PDF provenance boundary is not a defect in this r7 witness and
does not reopen CMP-AUD-035.

No output is accepted merely because its row count matches its raw source. Promotion
requires independent field/key conservation, exact source-role provenance, and the
applicable source-date-aware Excel-to-PDF record/category/section mapping. The latter
also owns evidence location and layered Report View placement/counts.

### Accepted Phase-4 source-format proofs — not app comparison canaries

These reproduce the authoritative TSN XLSX rows against their evidence/summary prints
and pass the second-review classifier mutations. They do not yet prove production
normalization, the app Comparison sheet, or evidence images.

| Proof | Exact source-format result | Result binding |
|---|---|---|
| Highway Detail | 60,081 PDF records paired to 60,083 XLSX rows over 12 districts / 4,123 pages; exact two XLSX-only duplicate occurrences; 3,003,609 projected-exact cells + 127,455 narrow render equivalents; exact 443-item dated-delta allowlist; 0 PDF-only, parser residue, unsafe attribution, unresolved cells, or SEG_ORDER inversions | `highway_detail_tsn_pdf_oracle_final.json`, SHA-256 `540b1ce575be880f506ebc435acaabe253e238f4eba312a72a310129f4ecdc36`; script `34d7aceb7717d285b48d440e0e762564615be2f4de0fd0b4827fa568277fc45b`; allowlist digest `d101bc1263188dcb436a9218bad6774ab047368e819c205d1e53b9b812b56d8a` |
| Ramp Detail + Summary | 15,410 XLSX = 15,410 PDF; 15,404 extracted-content exact + 6 hash/geometry/font-bound visible clip equivalents; exact four-item `(cid:13)` contract; all 18 XLSX fields disposition-bound; 0 date deltas; 0 unresolved; every Summary category and total exact; PM_SFX 313 = L165/R148 | `ramp_cross_format_oracle-v3.json`, SHA-256 `47383b5d00ed4b72fa72ed711d165c0ec633d2d7c8f86edd695f4f0a2e886ed1`; script `c580336cb2aa5fceae51230fc037f712e8ab2908e68561aa4402728ed93ae8a5` |
| Intersection Detail + Summary | 16,626 XLSX = 16,626 two-line PDF; 598,536 assertions; 578,432 exact + 20,103 directional/measured render equivalents + one exact allowlisted pull-time Description delta; 0 unresolved; 62 raw Summary rows → 58 normalized categories including Total; 116 explicit taxonomy-excluded detail rows conserved | `intersection-tsn-cross-format-oracle-v2.json`, SHA-256 `63f5741203b06ef37245f195953058cf45ec921c04aaa00ccf676e44baba2c2e`; script `ffc364ceb8b6cdbbfb3bff680cc0f3ed77e12c1867978c86122d221de7c78441` |

Both oracles enforce source sizes/hashes and fail-closed negative mutations. Ramp's first
date-delta classification was rejected and replaced with direct PDF content-stream clip
proof; its extraction-artifact and field-disposition gaps are closed. Intersection's
date flags are directional and its Description rule is the exact measured 32-character
boundary. It permits only the exact VEN/Route 001/blank-prefix/PM 23.907
Description pair when all other 35 fields and the source timing contract remain clean;
any second change revokes the authorization. Highway Detail likewise binds exact source
hashes, content-aware duplicate occurrence assignment, five narrow print projections,
and the complete 443-item allowlist; any change fails closed.

### Accepted Stage-6 raw-to-normalized conservation proofs

These consume the exact raw members and accepted `raw-2026-07-12-r7` normalized
artifacts. `audit=true` means the source-bound audit mechanism is complete; `full=false`
retains documented product loss and is not a provisional pass.

All seven families now have independently second-reviewed Stage-6 acceptance. Highway
Log's fresh 822-second and 823-second full-corpus replays produced byte-identical result
and acceptance files. Every product-red omission/delta remains open and is not converted
into an exception by these audit results.

  Its 2,986 members include 11 generated consolidated/sidecar artifacts; those are

Every selected family has exact Excel/PDF route-token coverage, including S/U suffixes.
These are dated bundle-level pairs, not proof of per-route single-query coalescing. The
217-route Intersection Summary/Detail universe consistently omits Route 170 relative to
the 6.19 218-route edition across every available 7.9 form.

Older editions are retained with exact version roles, not mixed into the current truth:

- `All Reports 6.19`: historical base; no Highway Detail, pre-July Intersection Detail;
- Highway Detail dev 7.7: 252+252 cross-build/vendor-provisional drift witness;
- Highway Sequence 7.8: 252 XLSX, four routes byte-different from 7.9;
- Intersection Detail 7.8: 217+217, eight XLSX routes byte-different from 7.9;
- copied `HSL PDF + IS Bundle 7.9`: duplicate evidence, not an independent edition;
- six-environment and 6.15 scratch/subset sets: targeted drift evidence only.

Generated `consolidated/`, `.outcome.json`, bundle-root normalized workbooks,
`comparison-outputs/`, `evidence-bundles/`, `report-samples/`, `_scratch/`, and verification
outputs are never raw truth. No fresh TSMIS Excel/PDF sibling is missing. New exports are
needed only for literal same-query coalescing or complete SSOR/ARS/dev/test parity. Raw
TSN Excel siblings are not present for Ramp Summary, Highway Sequence, Highway Log, or
Intersection Summary; app-built normalized XLSX must not be relabelled as those sources.

All 504 local audit members were compared directly to the authoritative Downloads
trees after the interrupted run: zero member differences. The result also retains the
four earlier inventory digests whose serialization was undocumented; they are provenance
only and are not substituted for the canonical hashes above.

Exact source/comparison facts:

- 126 unique ordered routes in all four TSMIS forms, including `005S`, `010S`, `015S`,
  and `880S`;
- Summary PDF↔Excel: 3,780/3,780 typed values identical, digest
  `57514b890de9d1e49ed605c0fa095fade6a264f821e8177ac19aa852d87c2f1b`;
- Summary total 15,216 on both formats; Detail Excel/PDF each contain 15,216 rows and
  match every route total; 626 Detail PDF pages;
- the nine-route unprinted Ramp-Type residual is exactly 22 same-pull Detail records,
  P=2 and V=20, with zero residue;
- intended TSMIS-vs-TSN truth: 29 shared, 0 TSMIS-only, 2 TSN-only (P/V), 5 identical
  shared, 24 differing shared; ordered `TSMIS - TSN` digest
  `a3cbf7528aa66989f08a0d28efd8ba0e4588b8e3675ef108b0b791fdd35a2d63`;
- TSMIS/TSN totals 15,216/15,410; TSN minus TSMIS = 194.

Production's source-backed projection is exact, including all 3,780 consolidation
values and familiar-sheet numbers. Its current generic comparison is not semantically
accepted: it emits 31 shared + one TSMIS-only row, 26 differing + five identical,
zero-fills P/V on TSMIS, and injects the 59-point no-linework display metric into the
verdict. The exact three semantic gaps are bound to CMP-AUD-024/025; provenance
requirements remain under CMP-AUD-071/076/146. (CMP-AUD-019 and 020 — the
producer-side completeness + per-side partition gates — are resolved; see the
findings ledger. Neither touched this vs-TSN oracle's counts.)

The oracle ran production twice per execution using stable XLSX member and workbook-
semantic digests that exclude only timestamp-bearing `docProps/core.xml`; every other
ZIP member is asserted. Two complete source-bound executions then produced byte-identical
result and acceptance files. Terminal state is
`source_truth_exact=true`, `production_value_projection_exact=true`,
`stage8_base_oracle_complete=true`, `production_comparison_semantics_exact=false`, and
`comparison_end_to_end_perfect=false`.

Independent comparison truth is **66 union rows, 58 shared, eight TSMIS-only, zero
TSN-only, 53 differing shared, and five identical shared**. TSMIS Total is **16,459**;
TSN Total is **16,626**; `TSMIS - TSN = -167`. The ordered typed comparison digest is
`60459ed21842e53460e10ddc60c66e1cdbab1bf716b76826a5f4128c8b8fc120`.
The eight structurally TSMIS-only rows remain absent—not zero—on TSN: Intersection Type
R/C/P/+, Control R/O/Q, and Left Channelization Y. The five equal shared rows are Highway
Group X, Lighting +, Control Z, Control +, and one lane.

The TSNR reference and the same-pull TSMIS Excel/PDF sources independently prove the
canonical mapping `F = Four-Way Flasher (Red on Mainline)` and `G = Red on All`. The raw
TSN Summary PDF erroneously prints “RED ON ALL” for both F and G. The comparison uses the
proven canonical F meaning, while CMP-AUD-145 remains red because normalization does not
retain the raw contradictory wording plus an explicit correction-provenance record.
Distinct raw J/K/L/M/N/P rows correctly project to shared Control S=2,648, but
CMP-AUD-144 remains red because the normalized artifact cannot reconstruct those six
source rows.

Production exactly reproduces every source-backed consolidated value, formulas/values
workbook twin, generic comparison status, one-sided blank, verdict, and familiar-sheet
number for this current source. It nevertheless is not end-to-end perfect: the exact
open product set is CMP-AUD-020/021/022/023/076/144/145/146/183/184, covering strict
typed count/partition/duplicate handling, route-universe validation, raw fold/correction
provenance, report metadata, and the familiar note's false zero-fill/Ramp-P/V wording.

Independent source truth keys rows by
`(Route, County, norm_pm(PM))`; `PR` and `PM_SFX` remain separately asserted facts.
The raw TSN side has 15,410 unique D4 identities. TSMIS has 15,216 rows, 15,215 unique
identities, and one exact duplicate group. The four TSMIS-only occurrences are
`005/LA/25.218`, `050/SAC/15.715`, `050/SAC/15.823`, and the extra duplicate at
`101/LA/1.284`; TSN has 198 one-sided identities. Exact comparison truth is:

| Flavor | Paired | TSMIS / TSN only | Identical / differing rows | Differing cells | Per-field differences |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| TSMIS Excel vs raw TSN | 15,212 | 4 / 198 | 14,471 / 741 | 847 | District 1; Date 15; HG 364; Area 4 58; City 156; R/U 68; Description 185; PR 0 |
| TSMIS PDF vs raw TSN | 15,212 | 4 / 198 | 14,438 / 774 | 998 | District 1; Date 15; HG 364; Area 4 58; City 156; R/U 68; Description 181; On/Off 95; Ramp Type 60; PR 0 |
| TSMIS PDF vs Excel | 15,216 | 0 / 0 | 15,212 / 4 | 4 | Description 4 |

The PDF↔Excel differences are the four route-010/RIV rest-area rows at PM 71.863,
72.028, 72.200, and 72.355 where Excel contains a literal `_x000d_` escape/newline and
the PDF omits it. All other observed render differences are fully classified: 306
HTML-whitespace collapses, 59 PDF dashes for Excel blanks, and 59 printed
`NO RAMP LINEAR EVENT` values for Excel blanks. The 500-data-page TSN PDF contributes
15,410 records with zero parser residue; its cross-format mapping accounts for every
XLSX field and all source-date differences.

Raw TSN vs normalized r7 pairs all 15,410 rows. Every asserted field is exact except
exactly 15 Description cells where production deletes an authoritative leading numeric
prefix. The current product therefore produces the same wrong output from raw and
normalized TSN: Excel-vs-TSN has 750 differing rows / 861 cells (Description 200), and
PDF-vs-TSN has 783 differing rows / 1,012 cells (Description 196). Relative to source
truth this adds 15 false Description differences and hides the one real District
difference. At `005/SD/72.366`, TSMIS Excel/PDF says District 12 and TSN says District
11; production omits District and reports the row fully identical. Its Route+PM key is
also unsafe: 81 weak TSN keys span 163 county identities. These exact red paths are
CMP-AUD-045/133/135/185; audit acceptance does not bless them.

Independent source truth keys rows by
`(base Route, County, complete PP, numeric Post Mile)`. The raw TSN side has 16,611
unique identities plus 15 exact duplicate groups / 30 duplicate occurrences. The weak
Route+numeric-PM shape has 78 cross-county keys / 156 county identities; even adding
complete PP leaves 71 cross-county keys / 142 identities. More importantly, six
within-county Route+numeric-PM groups contain distinct complete-PP values, so complete
PP is part of identity rather than merely a display claim. Exact source truth is:

The 217 TSMIS PDFs contribute 1,844 pages and all 16,459 expected records with zero
parser residue under independent per-document grids. The exact nine PDF↔Excel cells are
eight Description values whose Excel cells end in tab characters that PDF cannot render,
plus one HG disagreement at `108/TUO/<blank>/5.87`. At that row Excel says `U`; PDF,
raw TSN, and normalized TSN all say `D`, so the disagreement is classified as a current
TSMIS Excel export defect and remains visible. This replaces the stale shorthand that
the current PDF and Excel forms have zero non-whitespace differences.

The production witness rebuilt both TSMIS representations and executed five legs in
`mode="both"`: Excel/PDF against raw/normalized TSN plus PDF↔Excel. Independent workbook
inspection proved exact sheet universes, formula/value structures, source sheets,
very-hidden snapshots, paired-cell ledgers, one-sided inventories, and per-sheet formula
censuses on all ten workbooks. Production consolidation preserves every nonblank typed
cell and every explicit member Route/physical `S` value. Excel's only representation
change is exactly 125,152 explicit empty-string cells serialized as physical blanks;
PDF consolidation is raw-representation exact.

The raw product Report View has 16,886 logical records / 33,772 physical rows and maps
all 16,626 nonblank `MAIN_EFF_DATE`, `MAIN_ADT`, and `CROSS_ADT` claims. The normalized
leg emits the same record universe but all three columns are blank. Both PDF-vs-TSN legs
omit Report View. Every product comparison still declares and uses Route+PM, omits County
and District from Comparison, and re-derives Route/Suffix instead of exposing the exact
consolidated claims. The current corpus happens to reproduce the expected overlapping
cell and one-sided counts, but the permanent county/complete-PP swap mutations prove
that this weak identity can mask real changes. These exact red paths remain
CMP-AUD-045/068/070/133; no duplicate finding was created.

The audit-owned TSMIS parser reconstructs all 51,273 Excel rows and 51,216 PDF rows,
including 4,065 printed DCR headers, with zero unclassified PDF groups. Every Excel row
has non-circular snapshot-backed District/County ownership: 48,143 exact current
companion signatures, three unique-owner current companion keys, 3,125 exact same-build
7.7 route-005 rows, and two current 005S composite-description owner attestations. The
005S rule attests owner only; it synthesizes no PDF row or other cells. The later
route-005 PDF stays a separate snapshot, with all eight changed DCR owners frozen in
ledger `45a306a0f2872883cc0c1410b759f5c185cd23d890c1af9cfc659a7ef397a747`.
The 51,273-row classification ledger is
`87f92d930dd33187502e60f1b6d7dbf8f52b2d532fc0b806efeeb87c54bfc49b`;
zero owners come from TSN-only evidence.

The complete production witness authenticates both consolidations and all five
formula/value comparison pairs, including exact workbooks, sidecars, compressed payloads,
one-sided inventories, paired-cell ledgers, duplicate assignments, hidden snapshots, and
sheet/formula censuses. This exact reproduction is intentionally not semantic approval.
CMP-AUD-042/045/054/068/076/133/138/142/186 remain product-red for PS loss, weak
Route+Post-Mile identity, PDF parse loss, missing PDF Report View, absent durable source
identity, omitted source claims, one Length conversion, omitted snapshot dates, and the
route-395 multi-baseline truncation.

Current source truth already proved, but final replay is pending:

- exact independent census: 60,494 Excel / 60,493 PDF rows, 60,493 semantic
  PDF↔Excel pairs, zero PDF-only, and one Excel-only described row;
- four paired PDF Description omissions plus that Excel-only row: five unrepresented
  Description claims total; route 037 `003.809` is fixed in the current same-run pair;
- 1,410 paired rows / 3,721 same-source cells: Description 1,133, FT 1,129, HG 910,
  suffix 549; suffix comprises 272 two-row moves (544 cells) plus five PDF-only values;
- raw TSN has 69,804 records (68,806 data + 998 equates), including 46 pre-county
  equates; normalization emits 69,758 rows, blanks 565 pointer tokens, and changes one
  Description punctuation value;
- installed Excel proves four lowercase `_x000d_` cells decode to CRLF; product treats
  them as false Description differences;
- raw and normalized TSN each preserve 154 numeric-prefix Descriptions, while current
  product false-cleans 81 real differences by deleting authoritative TSN prefixes.

Direct-source checkpoint r2 is 98,943,666 bytes at SHA-256
`a8da9a24a50bf2b1ba58a8062566c1813a6518d9bede9d6fc2dec24d7fa657ce`;
its bound 112,009-byte script SHA is
`469c57d9b419b6bfbe6b0ee7a1e7171f896e3585af47cc392c00ebb2383d9dd2`.
It parses the exact captured bytes of all four 252-member TSMIS trees, reparses all 12
raw TSN PDFs, and streams the accepted normalized workbook. Complete raw shapes are
Excel 57,072 / 3,422 / 12,732 and PDF 57,505 / 2,988 / 12,299; the separately named
69,758-row keyable shapes end at 12,686 / 12,253. The 46-record unkeyed ledger SHA is
`bbd85ad3b3de2bf5312e6a2945270b4d1a521acc690de62dabe833a810f8aeab`.
All nine actual gate mutations are rejected and source residue is zero. The checkpoint
is deliberately `acceptance_eligible=false` and does not advance the 5/7 family count.
Independent review rehashed all 1,028 bound files and reconstructed every leg without
contradiction. That r2 checkpoint still exposes the CMP-AUD-224 hardening requirement:
current data has exactly 998 annotation-to-`E` and 998 `E`-to-annotation links with zero
orphan `E` rows, but r2 persists only the forward predicate. The final direct-source
audit-input twin below closes that predicate gap at its own builder layer; it does not
promote r2 or the Highway Sequence family.

  two byte-identical runs. Its four persisted pair maps, cell counts, and aggregate
  projection-plus-assignment arithmetic reproduce exactly. On fixed source pairs each leg has
  81 CMP-AUD-204 false-cleans plus 15 false-positive Description states; the product
  projection also mutates 90 cross-route TSMIS prefixes per form (plus four Excel
  CMP-AUD-197 CRLF rows). CMP-AUD-220 separately binds asserted-only assignment changes
  in 445/448 Excel and 357/360 PDF duplicate groups across raw/normalized TSN.
  Independent review found that its assignment zero-unexplained flag is tautological
  (CMP-AUD-221), its link guard dereferences before testing (CMP-AUD-222), and unrestricted
  output can alias/replace a frozen input after the final guard (CMP-AUD-223). This is
  explicitly cache-backed non-acceptance evidence, not a promoted canary; its exact
  arithmetic remains useful, but its original all-residuals-classified claim is
  superseded by the hardened result below.

  is `ca4c458b5e80faead676222ca8cada74090edaa8fb332a4a478f2173b7022cec`.
  Every authentic changed group has an executable source/product optimum proof
  (445/448 Excel and 357/360 PDF); an arbitrary 3-by-3 swap yields one terminal
  unexplained record. Real Windows file/directory symlink, hardlink, lexical-output,
  and bound-input-output probes reject. CMP-AUD-221/222/223 are remediated in the

  mutation, pre-resolve lexical/reparse guards, a real multi-level directory-symlink
  control, output-root disjointness, and zero formulas/errors are all green. Direct
  provenance also matches the prior development twin over all 69,804 values, references,
  contexts, and routes while reading no development cache. r1-r5 remain diagnostic/stale:
  r1 retains volatile core metadata, r2/r3 predate CMP-AUD-227, and r4/r5 resolve before
  their component walk. Most importantly, `result.json` says
  `acceptance_eligible=false`, `stage8_family_accepted=false`, and
  `PASS_DIRECT_SOURCE_AUDIT_INPUT_NOT_FAMILY_ACCEPTANCE`. This twin is only a promotable
  direct-source input fixture; the CMP-AUD-225 runner half and newly verified
  CMP-AUD-228 through 231 runner-gate defects remain open, as do product comparisons,
  Comparison/evidence verification, the permanent gate, detached decision, and final
  replay;
- development raw product results: Excel→raw result SHA
  `2691fe4a5d6d1ed757d788c16bed7226a7966db8c1950423daf194369e6ae58c`

  reports 57,505 / 2,988 / 12,299 with 4,929 cells. Their row shapes match the
  independent complete-raw universe. The independent 36,706-byte raw-output audit at
  SHA-256 `8b59cb5062be9e3345b68b7d7024436275dd5de8ee9cb0d20bb90a7d4b0e0abd`
  passes all 15 invariants: it authenticates the six inputs per leg, every raw provenance
  row, both formula/value twins, embedded source rows/cells, Comparison/one-sided/Routes
  sheets, pairing traces, sidecars/chunks, and exact artifact trees. Its status is
  `pass_with_product_defects` and `acceptance_artifact=false`; the cell semantics remain
  product-red and the cache-derived raw twin cannot replace the final direct-PDF replay.
- five-leg Summary/Spot semantic oracle: 35,937 bytes / SHA-256
  `331d4aba8321cb8e61080678f5b71357f3da249cdf02f5ad23b18ae01b9f7395`;

  `374ea7f8d4994a0e07b8dece903cb1ade5362bca014e0a5a85e11c8b7fcccb96`.
  It passes 13/13 invariants over all five legs and ten workbook twins, reconstructing
  every Comparison cell and exhaustive Summary/Spot maps from exact captured bytes.
  CMP-AUD-214 is present in all ten workbooks; CMP-AUD-218 wrong-pair and false-one-sided
  mutations each still return six `OK`s in every leg. Status remains
  `pass_with_expected_product_defects`, `acceptance_artifact=false`.

The 49,304,637-byte TSMIS row cache, 28,829,216-byte TSN row cache, 113,580,300-byte
comparison draft, 4,008,580-byte source-oracle draft, and Description-normalization
probe are explicitly development/non-acceptance accelerators. They may inform the final
gate but cannot replace reparsing the immutable sources. The direct-raw-PDF-built TSN
twin is now bound above as an input fixture only. Promotion still requires correction
and replay of the direct-source runner, product publications, permanent mutations,
evidence/flat-view coverage, terminal artifact-universe checks, detached acceptance,
and two byte-identical complete family replays.
`HSL-PDF-79` below remains the separately named historical cross-bundle canary.

**Product-loader verification (2026-07-16 — NOT family acceptance).** The Wave-4
Highway Sequence batch (CMP-AUD-045/155/156/158/159/199/204) rebuilt the normalized
TSN workbook at v4 from the 12 bound raw PDFs (`HSL Bundle 7.8\TSN\highway_sequence\
raw`, the 3,866,949-byte authoritative set) and verified against the same-run ssor-prod
7.9 consolidated pair:

- normalized workbook: **69,804 rows** (68,806 data + 998 equates; 46 blank-County
  annotations, all `EQUATES TO`), 283 `*P*` + 282 `-------->` pointer tokens verbatim,
  the KER 014 `018.365` join with no invented comma, 154 numeric-prefix Descriptions
  preserved, direction census {S-N 190, W-E 172, E-W 5, N-S 2}, one distinct policy
  text, identity claims OTM22025 / 15-SEP-25 / 15 SEP 2025 across all 12 documents;
- product leg SHAPES == `EXPECTED_CURRENT_LEGS` exactly: Excel-vs-TSN
  60,494 / 69,804 / **57,072 / 3,422 / 12,732**; PDF-vs-TSN 60,493 / 69,804 /
  **57,505 / 2,988 / 12,299**; PDF-vs-Excel **60,493 / 0 / 1** (CMP-AUD-199's
  suffix-free identity; PM Suffix 549 and HG 910 exact as compared cells);
- re-pairing the product-LOADED rows under the oracle's own assignment objective
  (all-field diffs, char distance, position) reproduces the oracle's complete
  per-field tables EXACTLY on all three legs (with the four proven-CRLF `_x000d_`
  Excel cells unescaped) — so the loader values/identities carry zero residual
  defects, and the live product's remaining deltas were precisely CMP-AUD-220
  (assignment objective; live counts asserted 5,582 / 4,995 / 3,725 vs the oracle's
  5,589 / 5,001 / 3,721+4) plus CMP-AUD-197 (the four `_x000d_` cells).

**Post-CMP-AUD-220 product counts (2026-07-16, same day, later — the live
current-canary numbers).** With the owner-approved assignment/verdict split and
the HSL `_v` OOXML decode live, the PRODUCT ENGINE itself lands on the Stage-8
oracle table EXACTLY on the same inputs — these are now the bound HSL vs-TSN
comparison canaries:

- Excel-vs-TSN: asserted **4,894 rows / 5,589 cells {Description 4,894,
  FT 695}**; all-field 23,691 / 30,005 {City 15,026, Desc 4,894, Distance
  6,972, FT 695, HG 2,418}; shape 60,494/69,804/57,072/3,422/12,732;
- PDF-vs-TSN: asserted **4,916 / 5,001 {Description 4,916, FT 85}**; all-field
  23,872 / 29,189 {City 15,140, Desc 4,916, Distance 7,056, FT 85, HG 1,992};
  shape 60,493/69,804/57,505/2,988/12,299;
- PDF-vs-Excel: **1,410 / 3,721 {Desc 1,133, FT 1,129, HG 910, PM Suffix
  549}**, 60,493/0/1 — unchanged;
- zero literal `_x000d_` survives the vs-TSN loader (the 197 HSL half).

Cross-family assignment re-bless bound to the same batch: RD (all 3 legs, the
one 101/LA/1.284 duplicate group) and ID (all 3 legs, 16/16/18 groups) pair
byte-identically under old and new objectives — every RD/ID canary above is
unchanged; HL Route-1 stays exactly **299 both / 18 / 69 / 221 / 969**; the
June `ground-truth/inputs` HL statewide diagnostic pair re-pairs 57/1,002
duplicate groups toward full-content identity (asserted cells in changed
groups 457→500; 96 TSMIS / 16 TSN one-sided membership moves) — that pair is
a diagnostic input, not a bound canary. **Highway Detail statewide was
re-measured 2026-07-16 (later the same day) and is EXACT under the post-220
objective**: the bound 7.7-bundle harness (`hd_full_verify.py`, re-run
unchanged but for the filed-bundle path) reproduces **48,644 both / 2,599
TSMIS-only / 11,439 TSN-only / 208,596 differing cells with RU Eff 48,211**
digit-for-digit — the objective change moved nothing statewide (RD/ID-class
behavior; consolidate `complete`, TSN normalize 60,083 rows / 273 routes,
both exact). The bundle's PDF↔Excel self-check leg reports 2,487 both /
5 cells on 3 rows with one-sided 2/5 against the pre-v0.26.0 README's 3/5 —
the v0.26.0 HD-PDF July-print parser fix legitimately changed that
secondary leg's parse; the bound statewide vs-TSN canary above is what this
re-measure blesses.

These are product-code verification facts for the Wave-4 batch; they do not advance
the Stage-8 family acceptance above (direct-source runner, permanent mutations,
evidence coverage, detached acceptance, and the two byte-identical replays remain
owner-gated).

**CMP-AUD-054 re-bless (2026-07-18) — HD-PDF fallback-grid recovery.** The Highway
Detail **PDF** consolidator (`consolidate_tsmis_highway_detail_pdf`) no longer parses
a band-less-line-1 page on the document median (which shifted every field). Bound to
`ground-truth/All Reports 7.9/2026-07-09 ars-prod/highway_detail_pdf/` (252 route
PDFs). Two censuses (`census_054_hd_grids.py` grid, `census_054b_fullparse.py`
full-parse):

- **Geometry proof:** on all **3,664 pages carrying both bands, the line-1 window
  set equals the merge of the line-2 base edges at `(0,1,3,5,6,7,9,11,12,14,25)` —
  0 exceptions.** So a page printing only the 25-cell line-2 band recovers its
  line-1 grid from its OWN band (`_win1_from_l2_band`), not the median.
- **17 fallback pages across 13 routes** recover this way (COMPLETE). Route 005's 4
  (pages 7/66/222/225) parse digit-for-digit as printed: e.g. p7 `005.009 000.083
  64-01-01 D F 64-01-01 SD U 64-01-01` (the finding's named record) and p225
  `788.545 000.370 74-08-22 …`. Old-vs-new on route 005: **3,068 → 3,070** — the two
  removed rows were the median's CORRUPT versions of 005.009/117.649 (blank Length,
  `Date=000.083`), absent from Excel; the four recovered rows are the faithful parse.
- **15 routes** (014/074/094/095/120/124/125/127/162/172/190/233/254) each carry ONE
  final UNSHADED record on a rect-less page — no page-local geometry. Rather than the
  median's shifted parse, these escalate the producer to PARTIAL and drop the
  un-parseable row (verified corrupt on 014/074; the finding's "incompatible fallback
  must be partial rather than converted"). Statewide new total_emitted **51,201**.
- **The Excel-vs-TSN statewide canary (48,644/2,599/11,439/208,596) is UNAFFECTED** —
  it consolidates from the Excel export, not the PDF. Only the PDF-sourced legs
  (PDF-vs-TSN, PDF-vs-Excel) move, by the recoveries + escalation above.

Hermetic guard: `check_highway_detail_pdf.test_fallback_recovery` (monkeypatched
`pdfplumber.open` — a fallback page recovers a correctly-aligned record the old
median dropped; a rect-less data page is unresolved/PARTIAL).

**CMP-AUD-056/057/058/059/060/062 no-op proof (2026-07-18) — ID PDF parser
reconciliation hardening.** The Intersection Detail **PDF** consolidator
(`consolidate_tsmis_intersection_detail_pdf`) now reconciles every data shape or
escalates the producer to PARTIAL (a strict `_is_rowB` requiring a Description; the
leading-orphan-rowB, wrapped-rowB, vestigial, mixed-edition, and per-page-geometry
counters). Bound to `ground-truth/All Reports 7.9/2026-07-09 ars-prod/
intersection_detail_pdf/` (217 route PDFs). Census (`census_id_bucketB.py`) +
output-safety proof (`verify_id_safety.py`, old-vs-new via `git stash`):

- **Every defect scenario is 0-occurrence statewide:** 062 max per-page boundary
  delta **0.000 pt** on BOTH the 21-cell and 18-cell grids, 0 classification / 0
  value divergences (the ID print grid is genuinely uniform — no per-page recovery
  needed, unlike HD-054); 060 vestigial 0; 059 mixed-edition files 0; 057 leading
  orphan rowB 0; 056 wrapped rowB 0; 058 rowB accepted without a Description **0 of
  16,459** (every real rowB carries one, so requiring it false-rejects nothing).
- **Byte-identical output old-vs-new:** 217 files, **16,459 emitted rows**, rows
  SHA-256 `5104861dcd19b68696d4a4ef495de58d3a0f91350383cc03220fa5df40d6fee4`
  IDENTICAL before and after the change; all six counters 0; 0 files would
  escalate. A discrepancy-safe no-op on the current corpus.
- The Excel-vs-TSN and other legs are untouched (this is the PDF consolidator's
  parse path only). Hermetic guard: `check_intersection_detail_pdf
  .test_reconciliation_hardening` (precise synthetic pages via monkeypatched
  `pdfplumber.open`; red→green — the OLD code lacks `_is_rowB`; clean-render no-op +
  e2e COMPLETE→PARTIAL escalation with the structured `parse_anomalies` diagnostic).

**CMP-AUD-051/052/053 re-bless (2026-07-18) — HD PDF parser: a "CONT" line-2
correction + header/orphan hardening.** Bound to `ground-truth/All Reports 7.9/
2026-07-09 ars-prod/highway_detail_pdf/` (252 route PDFs). Census
(`census_hd_bucketB.py`) + full old-vs-new row proof (`hd_per_route.py` old/new +
`diff_hd_json.py`, via `git stash`):

- **053 is a CORRECTNESS FIX (a 054-missed corruption), not a no-op.** The reprinted
  "Acc-Cont Eff" header wraps as "ACC-" then a bare "CONT" line; the parser consumed
  that "CONT" as a record's line-2, emitting a garbage record (cols 16/17 = "C"/"ONT",
  Description + all roadbed attributes BLANK) while the record's REAL line-2 was
  orphaned. Recognizing "CONT" (+ a dashed-district group header) as furniture makes
  each line-1 pair with its real line-2. **Exactly 7 records across 5 routes corrected**
  (route 018 ×1 "44TH STREET"; 101 ×3 incl. "WESTLAKE VILLAGE SCL"; 110 ×1 "FIGUEROA
  ST OFF RAMP , UC 53-533"; 152 ×1 "RT ON LAKE FROM LINCOLN"; 395 ×1 "BEGIN R
  REALIGNMENT") — each corrected row's Description + roadbed cells match the printed
  page. **Count unchanged (51,201); the ONLY content delta is those 7 records**
  (statewide rows SHA-256 **83fd8fb7…→f8cf36d0…**). The 2 remaining genuinely-
  unreconcilable leading orphans (route 395 alignment/wrap fragments) escalate the
  producer to PARTIAL (`leading_orphans`), never emitted.
- **052 is byte-identical** (0 rows moved): the `THEAD_RE` swap of bare
  `ROADBED`/`MEDIAN` for the header-only `LEFTROADBED`/`RIGHTROADBED` compounds keeps
  every one of the 516 statewide roadbed-header lines recognized while letting a real
  "BEGIN MEDIAN" description parse as data. 051 is closed by the 054 `_is_line1`
  hardening (0 residual phantoms on the 3 censused equate-spill shapes).
- **Downstream comparison consequence — RE-MEASURED 2026-07-18** (owed item closed).
  The HD-PDF workbook now carries the 7 corrected records, so the PDF-sourced legs
  lose their previously-differing garbage-"CONT" records. Re-measured statewide on
  the same `ground-truth/All Reports 7.9/2026-07-09 ars-prod/` HD corpus (252 PDF +
  252 Excel consolidated at code tip `b0add06`; normalized 7.7 TSN library, 60,083
  rows / 273 routes), values mode:
  - **PDF-vs-Excel: 50,724 both / 477 PDF-only / 549 Excel-only / 1,219 differing
    cells on 537 matched rows** (Length 362 / LB S/T 134 / LB Eff 133 / LB Wid 133 /
    LB #Ln 132 dominate). Row accounting reconciles: 50,724 + 477 = 51,201 PDF rows;
    + 549 = 51,273 Excel rows (the 15 CMP-AUD-054 band-less + 2 CMP-AUD-053
    leading-orphan escalations are the PDF-side drops). The corrected records now
    MATCH Excel — e.g. route 018 "44TH STREET" @ 007.796 reads status **Both**.
  - **PDF-vs-TSN: 48,173 both / 3,028 PDF-only / 11,910 TSN-only / 204,240 differing
    cells on 48,023 matched rows** (21 TSN-only routes = the unconstructed routes
    TSMIS doesn't export; RU Eff 47,740 / RB Eff 15,857 / Med Eff 15,737 dominate, the
    expected structural date-provenance classes).
  - The **Excel-vs-TSN** statewide canary (48,644 / 2,599 / 11,439 / 208,596, RU Eff
    48,211) is UNAFFECTED — it consolidates from the Excel export, not the PDF.
  Both PDF-sourced legs carry ≤7 fewer false diffs than the pre-053 garbage-"CONT"
  state (the 7-record correction is proven cell-for-cell above). Hermetic guard:
  `check_highway_detail_pdf.test_053_leading_orphans` + `test_line1_classifier` +
  `test_line2_furniture`.

**CMP-AUD-218 workbook-shape note (2026-07-16, later).** The comparison
workbook's Comparison sheet gained one hidden trailing literal column
(`__CMP_E2_KEY_V1_TOKEN`, both twins) and Spot Check gained the independent
key-token row match + Row-integrity line. NO count, status, or display
semantics moved: the same ssor-prod 7.9 HSL PDF-vs-Excel build returns the
bound 1,410 / 3,721 exactly, its token column is complete + injective over the
full 60,494-row union in both twins, the clean installed-Excel rebuild reads
all-OK (Row integrity OK, Summary SELF-CHECK OK), and a planted
consistently-relinked pair flips Row integrity to CHECK at statewide scale.
Pre-218 workbook BYTES are not comparable (one extra hidden column); every
bound COUNT canary in this file is unchanged.

**CMP-AUD-197 RD amendment (2026-07-16, later).** RD-79's **Excel-vs-TSN**
leg is amended: the four Cactus City Description diffs (route 010 @ 71.863 /
72.028 / 72.200 / 72.355) were the Excel export's OOXML-encoded CR
(`…_x000d_\n`) against a raw TSN extract that carries ZERO literal `_x000d_`
anywhere — export encoding, not data. With the load-boundary decode
(`compare_ramp_detail_tsn._v` / `_strip_desc_prefix`), the bound RD
Excel-vs-TSN canary is now **15,212 both / 4 / 198 · 737 differing rows /
843 cells {Area 4 58, City Code 156, Date of Record 15, Description 181,
District 1, HG 364, R/U 68}** (was 741 / 847 {Description 185}; every other
number identical). PDF-vs-TSN stays exactly **774 / 998** and PDF-vs-Excel
stays **15,216 fully identical** — both re-measured post-decode.

## Remaining canary queue

| Canary | Flavor / acceptance fact | Corpus source | State / blocker |
|---|---|---|---|
| `HD-77` | Historical full-edition compatibility/drift gate; its route-005 same-build pair is already bound for current Excel ownership, but the remaining 7.7 family must stay version-separated | `ground-truth\Hwy Detail Dev Bundle 7.7\` | `provisional` — Stage 9 historical-edition gate; current `HD-79` is accepted above and may not be blended with this vendor-provisional edition |
| `ID-78-PDF-XLSX-L6` | Historical-edition PDF↔Excel parity for the retained 7.8 pair; do not reuse the superseded zero-difference shorthand for current 7.9 | `ground-truth\Intersection Detail Bundle 7.8\` | `provisional` — Stage 9 historical-edition gate; current `ID-79` is accepted above, while the exact 7.8 434-member hashes and typed delta census remain to be bound |
| `HSL-78` | 57,071 paired, 3,422/12,687 one-sided, 5,521 differing cells; routes 242/10/21 | `ground-truth\HSL Bundle 7.8\` | `provisional` — exact consolidated/TSN member identities pending |
| `HSL-PDF-79` | PDF↔TSN 57,505 paired and 4,930 differing cells; PDF↔Excel 59,946 paired, 547/547 one-sided, 59,082 identical — measured on the CROSS-BUNDLE pairing (7.8 Excel with the first 7.9 PDFs) under the pre-CMP-AUD-199 glued-suffix identity | `ground-truth\HSL PDF + IS Bundle 7.9\` plus the HSL 7.8 Excel/TSN sides | `historical` (CMP-AUD-193, 2026-07-22) — role manifests bound in `HSL-79-current` above: historical 7.8 Excel tree `4bb040280bab17fd14283aa20178d189b4e499291eea1345adba0e0bb7f72c4f`, byte-identical first/current 7.9 PDF tree `072e538e5ebcbf015ec719565f003fb72027973a11d63c42f123802d8856dfa7`; the route-037 exemplars are frozen in the CMP-AUD-193 ledger entry (7.8 Excel 55,120 B `1e9e18ab…`, same-run 7.9 Excel 55,167 B `b271f74b…`, PDF 138,448 B `44d2535f…`). NEVER current acceptance — current truth is `HSL-79-current` + the post-220 product canaries |
| `HL-PDF-TSN` | Historical pulls reported 46,755 paired / 175,048 cells and later 46,919 / 175,269 | exact pull not durably recorded in the old artifacts | `blocked` — select one current corpus pair and independently establish a new identity-bound baseline; neither historical count is an oracle |
| `HL-PDF-XLSX` | The 7.9 corpus has 252 Excel and 252 PDF exports | `ground-truth\All Reports 7.9\` | `provisional` — an approved identity-bound self-check count has not been recorded |
| `BASELINE-ALL12` | One real two-day run over all 12 Matrix rows | no complete accepted pair selected | `blocked` — synthetic fixtures do not satisfy this acceptance gate |

`CORE-ID-78-XLSX-TSN` is intentionally not repeated in the remaining queue: it is the
baseline-bound Phase-3 gate described above. `CORE-STATEWIDE-619-HISTORICAL` is intentionally
absent because historical-only evidence is not pending acceptance work. `IS-79` is also
absent because it was promoted to the accepted Stage-8 Intersection Summary oracle above;
`RD-79` is absent because it was promoted to the accepted Stage-8 Ramp Detail oracle
above. `ID-79` is absent for the same reason; `ID-78-PDF-XLSX-L6` remains only as a
version-pinned historical Stage-9 gate. `HD-79` is also accepted above; `HD-77` remains
only as a separately versioned historical/vendor-drift gate. The earlier provisional/
blocked counts are superseded, not retained as competing truth.

## Deterministic member-manifest procedure

Use this procedure for `CORE-ID-78-XLSX-TSN` and every later directory-backed canary;
do not substitute a recursive corpus crawl, timestamp-only fingerprint, newest-file
selection, retained derived workbook, or historical comparison output.

1. Record the canary ID and the fixed absolute root-alias map. Resolve every path and
   require it to remain within its declared root. Enumerate only the exact depth and
   selector recorded by that canary.
2. Before hashing, enforce the required count, strict filename grammar, unique route
   token where applicable, unique case-folded relative path, and ordinary-file/no-
   reparse-point policy. Reject unexpected direct children and Office owner-lock files;
   do not merely omit them and continue.
3. For each selected member, stream SHA-256 from a stable read handle. Compare the file
   size and race-detection metadata before and after that read and abort if they change.
   Metadata is only a mutation guard; it is never content identity.
4. Begin with the literal header `# tsmis-comparison-canary-manifest-v1`. Serialize each
   record beneath it with exactly these tab-separated fields: `role`, `root_alias`,
   forward-slash `relative_path`, decimal byte `length`, and lowercase hexadecimal
   `sha256`. Record each canary's exact role tokens; this gate uses `tsmis_xlsx` and
   `tsn_xlsx`. Reject tabs, CR, LF, or ambiguous path components in names. Sort the full
   serialized record lines ordinally; that is equivalent to tuple order here.
5. Encode the header and records as UTF-8 without BOM, with LF line endings and one
   terminal LF, then SHA-256 those exact bytes. Record the member count, byte length,
   digest, absolute root map, and the full manifest itself with the canary run.
6. Immediately before producer execution, repeat exact enumeration and hashing and
   require the same manifest digest. After all comparison/Excel/independent-oracle work,
   repeat it again. Any membership, length, or content-digest change aborts the run and
   prevents re-blessing; pre/post timestamps alone never satisfy CMP-AUD-098.
7. Record derived consolidations, normalized libraries, values/formulas workbooks,
   comparison metadata, and Excel-recalculated copies as output members with their own
   identities. They are not raw input-manifest members. Separately bind the production
   source manifest, independent-oracle source digest, and all parser/consolidator/
   normalizer versions used by the run.

## Per-run binding record

For every semantic batch, append a dated record containing:

1. canary ID and exact side roles;
2. canonical paths plus file SHA-256/length, or a sorted member manifest and its SHA-256;
3. app/code identity, comparator/parser/normalizer/consolidator versions, and dirty-patch
   identity if the run is not from a clean commit;
4. pre-run and post-run input digests (CMP-AUD-098 remains open);
5. independently recomputed expected counts without importing the comparison engine;
6. values output counts and digest;
7. formulas output after Excel `CalculateFullRebuild`, all self-checks, parity result,
   and digest; and
8. any changed cells with a source-identity and domain explanation before re-blessing.

## 2026-07-14 — Highway Sequence final Stage-8 base binding

Highway Sequence is accepted at the audit/base-oracle layer, not remediated product
perfection. The final direct runner is 199,740 bytes / SHA-256
`bcc952fb3469b0e790e72eb25e1397f4639ef78ef1427ae2ea626d22ca001e91`.
Its immutable direct-leg terminal bindings are:

  `6aee127601ae5caeffa85f4404f1a34c44097fa22d7214ddee87a94e15f784a0`;
  counts 57,072 paired / 3,422 TSMIS-only / 12,732 TSN-only / 4,822 differing
  rows / 5,516 differing cells.
- PDF-vs-raw: `result.json` 37,735 bytes / SHA-256

  counts 57,505 paired / 2,988 TSMIS-only / 12,299 TSN-only / 4,845 differing
  rows / 4,929 differing cells.

Each root has exactly 10 ordinary singly linked files and no transient residue. The
139,453-byte final gate SHA-256 is
`b875437981626449810234922eeafe5f5aa5c716e893d22a5df5b7c65cf66a79`.
Two separate clean roots produced byte-identical 42,140-byte `result.json` files at
SHA-256 `f7f60e526b21935df8109e3772fc99b4cc3aded85e7294a6a83c7f19398d82fe`

`7e2e9ce44c14e3f5a095fa410548ff1de71eaf5820a2c348ed9ed52e40ca1c6c`.
The acceptance preserves all 14 known Highway Sequence product/evidence findings as red,
sets Stage-8 family promotion and end-to-end perfection false inside each single replay,
and authorizes only this documented two-replay base-audit conclusion. No product code
was changed.

## 2026-07-14 — Highway Log final Stage-8 base binding

Highway Log closes the Stage-8 base-family audits at **7/7**. This is acceptance of the
source-bound projection/current-product audit handoff only—not product perfection,
full-physical source conservation, workbook-cell evidence, or end-to-end perfection.

The oracle and product legs agree exactly on every per-field count and all 989 duplicate

Each r2 product root contains exactly seven ordinary files with no transient residue.
The Excel universe is 351,360,881 bytes with canonical manifest SHA-256

The earlier r1 product attempts are explicitly **nonaccepting**. Excel r1 stopped with
an incomplete transient publication and no terminal result. PDF r1 produced compact
canonical sidecars without a trailing LF, which the stale audit-runner byte check
rejected; it likewise produced no accepted leg result. Neither r1 root participates in
this binding. Both r2 legs were fresh, absent sibling roots and completed once without
deletion or retry.

## 2026-07-14 — Intersection Summary route-universe positive control (CMP-AUD-183)

Bound to the authoritative 217-file ars-prod tree
`Downloads\TSMIS\ground-truth\All Reports 7.9\2026-07-09 ars-prod\intersection_summary\`
(the same corpus as the Stage-8 Intersection Summary oracle) versus the raw
`Downloads\TSMIS\tsn_library\intersection_summary\raw\Intersection Summary Statewide_TSN.pdf`:

- the production consolidator's persisted `route_census` is exactly **217 ordered
  routes, `001`–`905`**, with the suffixed identities
  `008U, 010S, 014U, 058U, 178S, 210U` and **route `170` absent** (the dated
  universe fact — 6.19 had 218);
- the production comparison census-verifies (familiar-sheet note
  `TSMIS route universe verified against the producer census: 217 routes (001–905).`)
  and reproduces the accepted Stage-8 oracle unchanged: 58 shared / 8 TSMIS-only /
  0 TSN-only, 5 identical / 53 differing, totals 16,459 / 16,626;
- the finding's two isolated mutations on a sidecar-coupled copy now REFUSE:
  route `905` deleted → "the aggregated routes do not match the producer's route
  census"; route `001` duplicated → "route(s) 001 appear on more than one row".

Re-run via the production modules (consolidate → `write_outcome(extra=result.
producer_extra)` → compare); the hermetic mutation battery lives in
`build/check_compare_intersection_summary_tsn.py::test_route_universe`.

## 2026-07-14 — Ramp Detail production re-bless against `RD-79` (CMP-AUD-045/135/185)

The D4-integrated production comparators (county-aware `PhysicalKey`, District
compared, TSN Descriptions preserved with oracle-contract edge trimming,
route-matched TSMIS prefix strip, `ramp_detail` library v4) reproduce the
accepted RD-79 oracle **exactly, all three legs and every per-field count**,
from the same bound inputs (the ssor-prod 7.9 Excel consolidated workbook, the
scratch-consolidated 126-route ramp_detail_pdf tree, and the raw
`TSAR - RAMPS DETAIL_TSN_11.04.2025IT.xlsx`):

| Flavor | Paired | TSMIS/TSN only | Identical / differing rows | Cells |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Excel vs raw TSN | 15,212 | 4 / 198 | 14,471 / 741 | 847 |
| PDF vs raw TSN | 15,212 | 4 / 198 | 14,438 / 774 | 998 |
| PDF vs Excel | 15,216 | 0 / 0 | 15,212 / 4 | 4 |

Per-field: District 1 (the 005/SD/72.366 12-vs-11 disagreement now visible),
Date 15, HG 364, Area 4 58, City 156, R/U 68, PR 0; Description 185 (Excel) /
181 (PDF) / 4 (PDF↔Excel); On/Off 95 and Ramp Type 60 on the PDF leg. The two
route-126 trailing-tab rows compare equal per the oracle's declared edge-trim
reading contract; the four route-010 `_x000d_` rows stay honest differences.
The pre-fix production numbers (750/861 Excel, 783/1,012 PDF, Description
200/196, District omitted) are retired. Hermetic locks:
`check_compare_physical_identity` (RD contracts promoted to TESTS),
`check_compare_ramp_detail_tsn` (canonical-display keys + the two-county swap
+ v3-library refusal), `check_visual_evidence` (county-aware RD adapter).

## 2026-07-14 — Intersection Detail production re-bless against `ID-79` (CMP-AUD-045-ID)

The ID-79-integrated production comparators (county+PP-aware `PhysicalKey`,
District + County asserted compared fields, `intersection_detail` library v4)
reproduce the accepted ID-79 oracle **exactly, all three legs**, from the bound
inputs (both ars-prod 7.9 217-route trees scratch-consolidated + the raw
`TSAR - INTERSECTION DETAIL_TSN.xlsx`):

| Flavor | Paired | TSMIS/TSN only | Identical / differing | Cells | Asserted |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Excel vs raw TSN | 16,199 | 260 / 427 | 146 / 16,053 | 21,676 | 550,766 |
| PDF vs raw TSN | 16,199 | 260 / 427 | 146 / 16,053 | 21,683 | 550,766 |
| PDF vs Excel | 16,459 | 0 / 0 | 16,450 / 9 | 9 | 559,606 |

Pairing quality `exact` on every leg (TSN's 15 real duplicate groups ride the
Hungarian assignment). The 9 PDF↔Excel differences remain the 8 trailing-tab
Excel Descriptions (database data the PDF render drops) plus the REAL
`108/TUO/<blank>/5.87` HG defect (Excel `U` vs PDF+TSN `D`) — no edge-trimming
in this family. The pre-fix production shape (Route+PM keys, District/County
invisible, canary 21,675) is retired. Hermetic locks:
`check_compare_physical_identity` (ID contracts promoted, 8 green / 2
known-red), `check_compare_intersection_detail_tsn` (canonical displays, PP
identity probe, pre-v4 refusal), `check_visual_evidence` (county-aware ID
adapter, 34 FIELDS).

## 2026-07-17 — CMP-AUD-063 post-mile code vocabulary census (HSL-PDF + RD-PDF)

The unexpected-token → PARTIAL escalation must never false-fire on real data, so
it is bound to a read-only, serialized statewide census proving the current
corpora carry ONLY the accepted, versioned vocabulary (`PREFIX_SET =
frozenset("CDGHLMNRST")`; Highway Sequence equate `SUFFIX_SET = frozenset("E")`;
Ramp Detail has no suffix column; `PM_VOCAB_VERSION = 1`).

- **Bound corpus:** `ground-truth/All Reports 7.9/2026-07-09 ssor-prod/` —
  `highway_sequence_pdf/` (252 route PDFs) and `ramp_detail_pdf/` (126 route
  PDFs); the same 7.9 ssor-prod set the HSL Stage-8 / CMP-AUD-220 bindings use.
  ars-prod carries no PDF exports in this bundle.
- **Census result (via the production `parse_pdf`):**

| Report | PDFs | Rows | Prefix tokens seen | Suffix tokens | Unclassified / stray |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|---:|
| Highway Sequence (PDF) | 252 | 60,493 | C D G H L M N R S T | E (1,132) | 0 / 0 |
| Ramp Detail (PDF) | 126 | 15,216 | C L M R S T | (no column) | 0 / 0 |

  Every token ⊆ the accepted set, so both statewide consolidations STAY COMPLETE
  under the new gate (no false PARTIAL). Row counts are canary-exact (HSL 60,493,
  RD 15,216). If any future pull surfaces a token outside the set, it is a DATA
  question (disposition + a deliberate `PM_VOCAB_VERSION` bump), never a silent
  escalation. Census harness: this session's scratchpad
  `census_063_pm_tokens.py`; hermetic lock: `check_pm_code_vocabulary.py`.

## 2026-07-17 — CMP-AUD-027 header-only-route census (cross-env XLSX families)

The header-only-route → incomplete disclosure must never false-fire on a legitimately
data-less export, so it is bound to a read-only census proving no REAL per-route XLSX
export is header-only. Sweep of every per-route XLSX (the four flat cross-env families,
the same `row_has_data` contract `_load_xlsx_side` uses) in the bound 7.9 corpora:

| Report | Env / subdir | Files | Data rows | Min rows in any file | Header-only |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Ramp Detail | ssor-prod / `ramp_detail` | 126 | 15,216 | 1 | 0 |
| Highway Sequence | ssor-prod / `highway_sequence` | 252 | 60,494 | 5 | 0 |
| Highway Log | ssor-prod / `highway_log` | 252 | 51,884 | 2 | 0 |
| Highway Detail | ars-prod / `highway_detail` | 252 | 51,273 | 2 | 0 |

**756 real per-route exports, ZERO header-only** → a data-less per-route file is anomalous
(a truncated/interrupted export), so disclosing it as an incomplete input never turns a
real comparison partial. Census harness: this session's scratchpad
`census_027_empty_routes.py`; hermetic lock: `check_compare_env_route_universe.py`
(`test_027_*`).

## 2026-07-17 — CMP-AUD-018 Intersection Summary partition-gate census

The shared `record_problem` gate (require a Total when there is data + every non-exempt
section partitions it exactly) wired into the cross-env loader must never false-fire on a
real export, so it is bound to a read-only sweep of every real IS per-route export.

- **Bound corpus:** `ground-truth/All Reports 7.9/2026-07-09 ssor-prod/intersection_summary/`
  (217) + `…/2026-07-09 ars-prod/intersection_summary/` (217) = **434 files**.
- **Census (via the production `parse_route` + `_layout_drift`):** 217 records-with-data per
  environment; **layout-drift (a non-exempt section ≠ total): 0; data-but-no-Total: 0;** 0
  parse errors. Every real export has a valid Total with all non-exempt sections partitioning
  it exactly (Highway Group exempt), so the consolidation + cross-env gate never false-fires
  — every current statewide IS consolidation/comparison stays COMPLETE. Census harness: this
  session's scratchpad `census_018_is_drift.py`; hermetic locks:
  `check_consolidate_intersection.py` (`record_problem` + no-Total) +
  `check_compare_env_intersection.py` (`test_summary_layout_drift_disclosed`).

## 2026-07-17 — MER-059 dashed-district group-header census (TSMIS Highway Log PDF)

The dashed-district group-header rule (`GROUP_RE[0]` widened from `^\d{2}$` to
`^(?:\d{2}|[–—−]+)$`) must capture ONLY real section markers, so it is bound to a
statewide long-dash census of the TSMIS Highway Log (PDF) export.

- **Bound corpus:** `ground-truth/All Reports 7.9/2026-07-09 ssor-prod/highway_log_pdf/`
  (252 route PDFs) — the same set the HL same-source (PDF-vs-Excel) sweep uses.
- **Census (en/em/minus = U+2013/2014/2212):** across all 252 prints, exactly **2**
  long-dash lines, both dashed-district group headers followed by that section's data —
  `— MER 059` (route 059 p5, x0 354.4) and `— SBD 058U` (route 058U p3, x0 350.4). Class
  B (centered long-dash, not header-shaped) = **0**; class C (long-dash elsewhere) = **0**.
  So the widened rule captures only real headers; nothing else in the corpus can match.
- **Output effect (one cell statewide):** route 059 row 39's Description drops the
  "— MER 059" tail — `'BEGIN RT ALIGN,VIA 14TH / BEGIN RT INDEP ALIGN — MER 059'` →
  `'BEGIN RT ALIGN,VIA 14TH / BEGIN RT INDEP ALIGN'`, which is byte-exact the vendor Excel
  row (the Excel carries no "MER 059" text anywhere). Emitted count unchanged (162);
  route 058U byte-identical (its header sat in a non-attaching position); all 250 other
  routes untouched. Census/probe harnesses: this session's scratchpad
  `census_mer059_dashes.py` / `probe_059_mer.py` / `dump_hl_058U_059.py`; hermetic lock:
  `check_tsmis_pdf_parse.check_dashed_district_group_header`.

Acceptance evidence (all three legs PASSED 2026-07-22): the shipped-path E2E
(`run_e2e.py`, ConsolidateWorker → tsn_library.build_consolidated → compare
mode="both"), then `ground-truth\Clean Road and ArcGIS layers\_analysis\audit_v0290.py` —
(A) an INDEPENDENT recomputation from the two committed inputs (no scripts/
arithmetic) reproduced the pairing and EVERY per-column differing-cell count
exactly (223,473 / 42,129 / 52,647·5,081·7,436; 1 duplicate-key group,
min-diff matched identically); (B) the values workbook's own visible
Status/Diffs cells sum to the same totals and the Notes carry all 74
provenance lines; (C) a real-Excel COM CalculateFullRebuild of the
live-formulas edition equals the values twin CELL-FOR-CELL across all 65,164
Comparison rows. Oracle JSON: `audit_v0290_oracle.json` beside the script.
Known open classes feeding the counts (roadmap-tracked): the block eff-date
composite rule, the 0.001 sliver policy, od-less multi-county coverage holes.
The ADT trio + offset pair are CONTEXT pending the profile-continuation fit —
they appear in no count above.

### CRH-SW-E2 — the v0.29.1 re-bless (supersedes CRH-SW-E1's expected counts)

Same recipe, two owner-directed semantic changes (2026-07-22 late): the ADT
profile trio (Profile / ADT / Change-per-mile) is COMPARED AND COUNTED (the
Notes name the two model-fit classes inside the count), and THY_CITY_CODE is
COMPARED through the derived `scripts/city_codes.py` table (395 entries,
99.92% co-location agreement). 50 columns compared / 24 context.

Expected approved result: **52,647 paired / 5,081 ArcGIS-only / 7,436 TSN-only
(UNCHANGED — the key structure did not move) / 50,012 differing rows /
291,292 differing cells / 2,635 fully identical**. New counted columns:
ADT 35,839 · CHANGE_PER_MILE 23,116 · CITY_CODE 6,760 (route-001 city
agreement measured 96.2%; residuals are span coverage holes, not mapping
errors). The ArcGIS side rebuilt with the city column painted:

Acceptance evidence (all three legs PASSED on this pair, 2026-07-22 late):
the independent oracle reproduced the pairing and every per-column count
exactly (291,292 / 50,012 / 52,647·5,081·7,436); the values workbook's own
cells sum to the same; the real-Excel COM full rebuild of the formulas
edition equals the values twin cell-for-cell across all 65,164 rows. Oracle
JSON beside `audit_v0290.py`. Gate 153/153 + ruff clean at the tag.

### CRH-SW-E4 — the DA2 build-only column + the DA5 block-eff-date rule (MEASURED 2026-08-20)

**Superseded the PENDING placeholder that stood here.** It said the dev box could not run
this canary because no TSN extract was staged. That was wrong: the extract is not in
`tsn_library/`, but `CA HIGHWAYS 09.08.2025.xlsx` is in the local corpus, and the run was
made from it.

Two changes since E3, and they were separated by a same-layers A/B rather than attributed
by assumption:

| | E3 (2026-07-20 layers, oldest-member rule) | control (2026-08-19 layers, oldest-member) | **E4 (2026-08-19 layers, primary rule)** |
|---|---|---|---|
| paired | 52,647 | 52,629 | **52,629** |
| differing cells | 291,127 | 287,193 | **281,393** |
| fully identical | 2,635 | 2,841 | **3,687** |
| skipped source spans | 102 | 146 | 146 |

* **The layer refresh** accounts for −3,934 cells, +206 identical, −18 paired — and for
  the skipped-span count going 102 → **146**. The August drop carries 44 more unplaceable
  spans in the 2025-09-08 slice than the July drop did; the historical reconstruction is
  NOT frozen just because the as-of is.
* **The rule (DA5)** accounts for −5,800 cells and +846 identical rows, with **pairing
  bit-identical at 52,629** — it moves values only, which is exactly what a per-cell rule
  change should do.

Also present since E3: `THY_POPULATION_EFF_DATE`, the build-only 75th column (DA2). It is
CONTEXT here — TSN has no counterpart — so it is shown and never counted, and it does not
appear in any figure above.

**Not claimed.** These numbers come from the raw extract directly, not from the normalized
TSN library, and the ArcGIS side is a `partial` build (146 unplaceable spans). Both sides
of E3 used the July layer drop, which no longer exists on this machine, so the E3 column
is quoted from its own record rather than re-measured.

### (superseded) CRH-SW-E4 — the DA2 build-only column (OWED: not yet run)

**Status: PENDING on the owner's machine.** v0.39.1 adds a 75th column to the
BUILT sheet — `THY_POPULATION_EFF_DATE`, sourced from
`SHS Population.InventoryItemStartDate` (roadmap DA2; Highway Detail prints it as
`RU Eff` on 99.3% of its rows and could not fill it before). The dev box cannot
run this canary: it has no staged `CA HIGHWAYS` extract, so the E3 numbers below
could not be re-measured here.

**What is expected to change:** the built workbook's header and every row gain one
cell, so its SHA changes and the values twin gains a column.

**What is expected NOT to change:** every count. The new column is declared CONTEXT
(`chc.CONTEXT_COLUMNS`, now 25) because the TSN extract has no counterpart for it, so
it is shown with both sides' values and never counted — the same treatment the other
24 already get. `chc.HEADER` is untouched at exactly TSN's 74, so the raw-extract gate
and the normalized library are byte-identical; `chc.ARC_HEADER` (74 + build-only) is
what the build writes and what the comparison shares, and a TSN row simply has no cell
at the build-only position. Paired / one-sided / differing rows / differing cells /
fully identical should all read exactly as E3.

`build/check_clean_road.py` proves that shape end to end on its synthetic library
(the built header is `ARC_HEADER`, provenance covers every built column, and the
counted-difference assertion still reports exactly the ONE planted difference), which
is why this is recorded as an expected no-op rather than a predicted new number. Run
it and record the actual counts before treating it as blessed.

### CRH-SW-E3 — the RB-1 / HF-01 re-bless (supersedes CRH-SW-E2's expected counts)

Same recipe and the same raw inputs (the ArcGIS layer library and the
`CA HIGHWAYS 09.08.2025` extract are byte-identical to E2's), one owner-ruled
truth change (2026-07-26, PCOA-FINAL-010): the build RECORDS the 102 as-of
source spans whose begin or end postmile is unreadable (`LocError=NO ERROR`,
usable AR/odometer measures — the county+postmile contract never guesses from
those calibrations), reports **PARTIAL** completion with `skipped_inputs=102`,
itemizes every span on the `ArcGIS Build` sheet and in the
`clean_road_build.skipped_source_spans` sidecar, and emits the reserved
non-asserting marker `(unavailable: source span skipped)` into the **174**
anchor cells whose painted value was not the skipped span's own (162 formerly
blank + 3 formerly stale + 9 on rows that do not pair). The comparison schema
declares the token non-asserting via the one opt-in
`CompareSchema.unavailable_rule` field: those cells render state `N`, display
the marker, and are excluded from every difference count; Summary and Notes
state the span count, the marked-anchor count and the reason.

Expected approved result: **52,647 paired / 5,081 ArcGIS-only / 7,436 TSN-only
(UNCHANGED) / 50,012 differing rows (UNCHANGED — every affected row keeps at
least one real difference) / 291,127 differing cells (was 291,292; −165 =
exactly the Codex-witnessed skipped-anchor `D` cells, now explicit `N`) /
2,635 fully identical (UNCHANGED)**. Per-field deltas, all four from the
witness: `THY_LT_TRAV_WAY_WIDTH_AMT` −82 · `THY_LT_LANES_AMT` −81 ·
`THY_RT_O_SHD_TOT_WIDTH_AMT` −1 · `THY_RT_O_SHD_TRT_WIDTH_AMT` −1. Typed
outcome: asserted_cells 2,579,538 / context_cells 1,263,693 (the same 165-cell
shift; 52,647 × 73 exactly). The comparison itself reports PARTIAL — the
producer's truthful partial coverage propagated by `_merge_input_outcomes` —
and can no longer read green while source rows are unplaceable.

Acceptance evidence (RB-1, 2026-07-27): (A) a build-level cell diff of the new
built workbook against the frozen audit-approved E2-era build (SHA
`8F9766AC…`) shows the SAME 57,728-row universe and ZERO cell changes outside
exactly the 174 witnessed anchors; (B) an app-free lockstep recount of the old
vs new values twins verifies the 165 witnessed `D`→`N` flips cell-for-cell
(masks + displays), the 20 matched-at-anchor cells untouched, the 9 one-sided
anchor displays carrying the marker at state `U`, totals 291,292 → 291,127
with no other mask/display/status/key change anywhere, and the TSN data sheet
identical (the rebuilt normalized input's projected content equals the old);
(C) the real-Excel COM full rebuild of the formulas twin recomputes the same
truth live (SELF-CHECK all OK, verdict 291,127, the witnessed positions
live-`N` with the marker, no error cells). Witnesses:
`hotfix-bundles/HF-01/witness/` (this repo) and
`Downloads\TSMIS\_scratch\post-comparison-hotfixes\HF-01\`. The Phase-3
decision gates are honored: the equality change is opt-in per-report schema
(`unavailable_rule`), proved inert for every other family (Intersection
Summary vs TSN regenerated identically, zero cells, on both code states), and
the count move is exactly the owner-ruled 165-cell witness — nothing else.

**Review-1 remedy rebuild (2026-07-28).** RB-1's first review denied the bundle
on a PRESENTATION defect only (RB1-R1-001: the new `ArcGIS Build` disclosure was
stored at Excel's default width/height and clipped). The remedy gives that sheet
measured stored column widths, wrapped cells in tall-enough rows, and states the
102 skips as an itemized 14-column table; the build was regenerated, so the
ArcGIS input identity above moved from `8BDD9247…` (10,828,144) to
`1ADB5944…` (10,833,361). **Nothing else in this canary moves**: a cell-level
diff of the two builds shows **0** differences across all 57,729 data rows,
Provenance identical, the same 174 marker tokens and the same `102 / 174`
sidecar record, so every expected count above — 291,127 differing cells, the
paired/one-sided/differing/identical row totals, the four per-field deltas and
the typed asserted/context split — is re-verified unchanged on the regenerated
twins. The TSN normalized input is the SAME cached artifact (`7F1086FE…`), not
a rebuild.

**Review-2 remedy rebuild (2026-07-28).** RB-1's second review denied the
bundle on a DISCLOSURE gap only (RB1-R2-001: the genuine raw-source
disagreements were itemized in the witness but not in the comparison's own
Summary and Notes). The remedy makes the build record what each unavailable
marker withholds — a new itemized `ArcGIS Marked Anchors` sheet — and the
comparison itemize every marker that withholds a value TSN does not show. The
build and both twins were regenerated, so the input identities move again:

**Nothing else in this canary moves.** A cell-level diff of the review-2 build
against the review-1 build shows **0** differences across all 57,728 data rows,
Provenance identical, the same **174** marker tokens and the same `102 / 174`
sidecar record; the new sheet is wholly additive (183 rows = 1 header + 174
marked cells + the 8 extra records the co-anchored cells owe) and the marker
sheet gains exactly one pointer row. A full-sheet lockstep diff of the two
values twins shows the `Comparison` sheet **cell-identical over 65,165 rows**,
`Spot Check` / `Routes` / both `Only in …` / both data sheets and BOTH
very-hidden `__CMP_E2_SNAPSHOT_A/B` all at **0**; only `Summary` (1 cell — the
disclosure bullet), `Notes` (the disclosure block) and `Provenance` (4 cells —
input path + SHA) differ. So every expected count above is re-verified
unchanged on the regenerated twins.

The TSN normalized SHA differs from the review-1 row because the review-1 run
executed from the `TSMIS-rb1-worktree` working tree and this one from the main
checkout: `paths.DATA_ROOT` is per-tree, so each holds its own normalized copy
independently built from the IDENTICAL raw extract
(`CA HIGHWAYS 09.08.2025.xlsx`, `BBD1ACF9…`, 21,290,781 bytes). This is the
PCOA-FINAL-017 byte non-determinism already noted above, and the content
equality is proved directly: the `TSN` data sheet and `__CMP_E2_SNAPSHOT_B` are
cell-identical across 60,085 and 60,084 rows respectively. **When re-verifying
this canary, bind to the raw extract and the projected content, not to a
normalized SHA — that byte image is per-tree.**

## 2026-09-02 — CMP-AUD-246: the Highway Sequence Excel-vs-TSN equate seat (re-bless)

The pre-fix comparator on the 7.9 inputs reproduces the bound canary EXACTLY — 57,072 /
3,422 / 12,732; 23,691 differing rows / 30,005 cells {City 15,026, HG 2,418, FT 695,
Distance 6,972, Description 4,894} — which is the content-equivalence proof for the

The 7.9 PDF-vs-TSN leg could not be re-run here: the filed 7.9 PDF consolidation predates
the CMP-AUD-066 PDF-conversion marker and is refused by both the pre- and post-fix module
alike (the same refusal), so its "untouched" claim rests on the 8.31 identity above and on
the code path (`TSMIS_PDF_VS_TSN` loads through `_load_tsmis`, which still reads the
export's own seat).
