# Reports

What this doc covers: the full TSMIS report catalog (**fifteen** exportable types — incl. the six print editions (Ramp Detail / Highway Sequence / Highway Log / Intersection Summary / Intersection Detail / Highway Detail) and Ramp Summary's Excel sibling — plus the greyed **Route History** placeholder), the **[capability matrix](#capability-matrix--what-the-app-can-do-with-each-report)** (what the app can do with each report today), each report's per-export behavior (`ReportSpec`, save strategy, empty/ready detection), why the site greys reports out (`cs-disabled`), the **[integration ladder](#the-integration-ladder--every-touchpoint-when-a-report-levels-up)** (every touchpoint when a report gains a tier), and the three "add a new X" recipes (report type, consolidator, comparison).

Deep Highway Log internals live under [highway_log/](highway_log/columns.md) -- the corrected 31-column labels in [highway_log/columns.md](highway_log/columns.md), PDF/TSN parsing in [highway_log/pdf-and-tsn-parsing.md](highway_log/pdf-and-tsn-parsing.md), and the PDF-vs-Excel/TSN study in [highway_log/comparison-study.md](highway_log/comparison-study.md). The comparison workbook engine is owned by [comparison-engine.md](comparison-engine.md).

## The report catalog

| # | Report | Output | Folder |

| 8 | Highway Summary | XLSX | `output/<run>/highway_summary/` |
| 8b | Highway Summary (PDF) | PDF (Letter, portrait) | `output/<run>/highway_summary_pdf/` |
| — | Route History Table | *(none — greyed reserved placeholder, v0.25.1)* | — |
| 9–11 | Clean Road: Highway / Intersection / Ramp | XLSX | `output/<run>/clean_<kind>/` |
| 9b–11b | Clean Road: … (PDF) | PDF (Letter, landscape; v0.45.2) | `output/<run>/clean_<kind>_pdf/` |

`<run>` is a run folder, `"<YYYY-MM-DD> <src>-<env> <host>-site"` (e.g. `2026-10-07 ssor-prod dev-site`; the site tag arrived in v0.49.0, so an older `2026-06-11 ssor-prod` folder reads as *site not recorded*) -- see [engine-and-reliability.md](engine-and-reliability.md) for run-folder mechanics and [architecture.md](architecture.md#run-folders-v0100-replaces-bare-dated-outputs-site-tag-v0490) for the site tag.

The catalog (`scripts/report_catalog.py`) is the single source of truth for report metadata (P4); `reports.py` derives `EXPORT_REPORTS` from it, feeding the GUI checkboxes and `export_multi.py`, so the list can't drift. The `.bat` menus keep their own text, with a registry-parity check for the consolidate menu (`build/check_report_catalog.py`). Each row is `(menu label, format hint, ReportSpec)`. **Console** numbering follows `EXPORT_REPORTS` order; the **GUI picker** is grouped to mirror the website — its order comes from the catalog's `_PICKER_ORDER` / `picker_order()` and each entry's optional `group` + `short_label` (v0.18.1; see [Report grouping & site-menu-safe selection](#report-grouping--site-menu-safe-selection-v0181) below).

## Capability matrix — what the app can do with each report

The at-a-glance status of every export type across the app's capability tiers, as of
**v0.48.0**. Derived from `report_catalog.py` (EXPORT / CONSOLIDATE / COMPARE / TSN) +
`visual_evidence._ADAPTER_MODULES` — when a tier lands or a report is added, update this
table in the same change.

Plus one **consolidate-only source** (not an export type): **TSN Highway Log (PDF)**
(`cons:tsn_highway_log`) — TSN district prints the user drops into
`tsn_library/highway_log/raw/` (the library IS the drop location; v0.30.0
retired the separate `input/` folder).

**Footnotes — the current gaps, each with its unlock:**

1. **The three second editions of the summaries are fully integrated — v0.48.0.**
   Ramp Summary (Excel) (id 13, the site's `rs_exportToExcel` — an AOA workbook of the
   same count tables the PDF consolidator extracts), Intersection Summary (PDF) (id 14,
   `ints_printAll`) and Highway Summary (PDF) (`hs_printAll`) were export-only until
   the 2026-10-02 statewide delivery (`ground-truth/All Reports 10.2`) gave real files
   to verify against (Lesson 13). Each now has a consolidator that writes the SAME
   workbook shape as its sibling edition (equal counts on every route of the
   delivery), vs TSN against
   the sibling's TSN dataset, cross-environment, and a PDF-vs-Excel self-check on the
   PDF row — which for Ramp Summary is row 1, because there the PDF is the base
   edition.
2. **Ramp Detail (PDF) graduated to fully integrated in v0.26.0** (the Highway
   Sequence (PDF) path: export v0.24.0 → the rest off the first real work-PC print
   set, `ground-truth/All Reports 7.9`). The print carries TWO columns the Excel
   export DROPS — the On/Off indicator and the Ramp Type letter — which TSN's
   database also carries, so the PDF-vs-TSN flavor COMPARES them (they stay context
   in the Excel flavor and the PDF↔Excel self-check). See
   [Ramp Detail (PDF)](#ramp-detail-pdf--the-fully-integrated-print-edition-export-v0240-the-rest-v0260)
   for the censused conventions + canaries.
3. **Highway Summary FULLY integrated — v0.37.0.** The vendor un-greyed it
   (and Highway Detail) on **2026-08-17**; the export delivery
   (`ground-truth/HD + HS Release 8.17/`) is 252 statewide routes with ONE skeleton
   across every file, and the owner supplied the statewide TSN print the same day
   (`ground-truth/Highway Summary TSN print 9.15/`, event 4843734, reference
   09/15/2025). v0.37.0 ships the consolidator, the cross-environment comparator AND the vs-TSN leg (see
   [Highway Summary](#highway-summary--the-miles-measured-aggregate-v0370) below).
   It is the THIRD aggregate summary comparison and the first that measures MILES.
4. **Where each report lives (site-side, as of 2026-07-10):** EVERY enabled report
   now exports from the **production** site — the late-2026-07-09 prod rollout
   un-greyed Intersection Summary/Detail and Highway Detail (verified on both data
   sources in `ground-truth/All Reports 7.9`), ending the dev-site dependency.
   **Highway Summary and Highway Detail were released on 2026-08-17** and export from
   prod like the rest; Route History exists on dev only.
5. **Evidence images require a row-level comparison and a TSMIS PDF edition** — the
   generator renders the exact differing CELL from both systems' prints. The two
   aggregate comparisons (Ramp Summary, Intersection Summary) compare statewide
   category COUNTS, so there is no per-row cell to render; they are named in the
   toggle's no-support line by design.
6. **Route History Table is a wired-but-DISABLED placeholder** (stable id 15,
   v0.25.1 — the v0.18.1 reserved-groundwork pattern): the dev site's new report is
   an embedded SSRS page (`route_history.js` iframes the TSN report server; users
   pick parameters in the SSRS panel) with NO export control, so there is nothing
   for the engine to drive. It shows greyed in the picker
   (`reports.DISABLED_EXPORT_SUBDIRS`); if the site later gives it an export flow,
   enabling it = write the real save + drop its subdir from the gate.
7. **The Clean Road Files group is EXPORT-ENABLED (2026-09-02)** (stable ids
   16/17/18): reserved 2026-07-22 off the dev site 7.21 capture (a `cs-header`
   "Clean Road Files" + three `cs-option cs-sub cs-disabled` entries with **no
   `clean_*.js` module** behind them — exactly where Highway Detail/Summary sat
   on the 6.26 capture), then un-greyed on the dev site 9.1 capture (BUILD_DATE
   2026-08-19), which ships `clean_highway.js` / `clean_intersection.js` /
   `clean_ramp.js`. `export_clean_road.py` carries real Excel-sibling specs
   (the Clean Road section under Per-report specifics). **v0.48.0 integrates the
   SITE exports** off the 2026-10-02 statewide delivery: consolidators for both
   editions (the print is read with pypdfium2 straight off the site's print table —
   [Clean Road site exports](#clean-road-site-exports--consolidate-and-compare-v0480)),
   vs TSN against the TSN `CA HIGHWAYS` / `CA INTERSECTIONS` / `CA RAMPS` extracts
   (the columns the site has no source for are context, never counted),
   PDF-vs-Excel, and cross-environment. **Evidence images are not wired** for these
   prints yet. Where prod still greys one, `select_report` fails fast. **Since v0.29.0 the HIGHWAY file has a
   different, live path that doesn't need the site at all — the ArcGIS tab**:
   the owner's per-layer ArcGIS exports in `arcgis_layers/` build OUR own
   74-column CA HIGHWAYS table (`consolidate_clean_highway`), the staged TSN
   `CA HIGHWAYS` extract normalizes through the live
   `tsn_load_clean_road.build_into_highway` (marker v1), and
   `compare_clean_highway_tsn` diffs the two in both flavors with every column
   indexed back to its source layer (the built workbook's `Provenance` sheet +
   the comparison Notes). The Intersection/Ramp ArcGIS builds are not written
   yet (roadmap G1) — they follow the same pattern (design + censused mappings in
   [planning/cleanroad-highways.md](planning/cleanroad-highways.md)), and the
   site's own Intersection/Ramp exports, real since the 2026-10-02 delivery, are
   what those builds will be compared against.

**Cross-cutting engine capabilities** (all reports, unless noted): resume + retry +
skip/cancel + fast-fail per route; **fast mode** (N parallel browsers);
**coalescing** (selecting both editions of one report generates each route once —
HL, ID, HD, HSL, RD pairs — on the standard path since v0.19.2, in fast mode and
for matrix-queued edition steps since v0.32.0); **dated per-route filenames**
(v0.32.0 — run-folder identity front-anchored, legacy names honored on resume;
see [engine-and-reliability.md](engine-and-reliability.md));
**auto-consolidate on export finish** (the
twelve `_AUTO_CONSOLIDATOR` families — the PDF editions consolidate via the matrix
instead, needing a scratch convert dir; Ramp Summary's native PDF is the exception); the **Everything matrix** + **Compare by-day
matrix** (one row per comparison-integrated family; env / vs-TSN / vs-Excel modes per
row); **on-demand per-cell evidence cameras** on built, fresh vs-TSN cells (the
evidence-capable rows above).

TSN-side datasets backing the vs-TSN column (`report_catalog.TSN`; the library
normalizes each raw source once and caches it — see
[tsn-parsers.md](tsn-parsers.md)):

| TSN dataset | Raw source | Norm ver | Evidence prints |
|---|---|---|---|
| `highway_log` | exactly one internally claimed D01–D12 PDF | 5 | the same `raw/` prints (`_TSN_PDFS_IN_RAW`) |
| `ramp_detail` | statewide XLSX | 5 | `pdf/` drop: the ONE statewide TASAS print |
| `ramp_summary` | statewide PDF | 3 | — |
| `intersection_summary` | statewide PDF | 3 | — |
| `intersection_detail` | statewide XLSX | 5 | `pdf/` drop: the ONE statewide TASAS print |
| `highway_sequence` | exactly one internally claimed D01–D12 PDF | 4 | the same `raw/` prints (`_TSN_PDFS_IN_RAW`) |
| `highway_detail` | statewide XLSX | 4 | `pdf/` drop: the 12 district prints |
| `highway_summary` | statewide PDF | 2 | — |
| `clean_highway` | statewide XLSX (`CA HIGHWAYS`) | 1 | — |
| `clean_intersection` | statewide XLSX (`CA INTERSECTIONS`) | 1 | — |
| `clean_ramp` | statewide XLSX (`CA RAMPS`) | 1 | — |

Each edition of a report reads its family's ONE dataset (`tsn_subdir` on the matrix row):
Ramp Summary (Excel) reads `ramp_summary`, the summary PDFs read their Excel sibling's,
and both Clean Road editions read `clean_<kind>`.

## `ReportSpec` -- what makes one report differ from another

Defined in `scripts/exporter.py`. Each report's differences live in a `ReportSpec`; the proven per-route loop, recovery, and skip/cancel logic live ONCE in `exporter.py`. To fix one report's behavior, edit only its `ReportSpec`.

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `label` | str | the `#customReport` option's full text / `data-label` (e.g. `"TSAR: Ramp Summary"`); used as the **fallback** match when `data_value` is unset/unmatched, and as the menu-display label |
| `data_value` | str \| None | the site's **stable option id** — the `<li>`'s `data-value` (== the hidden native `<select>` value, e.g. `"Ramp_Summary"`, `"intersection_detail"`). Matched **FIRST** (v0.18.1) so selection survives the site's flat→nested report-menu migration; `None` ⇒ fall back to `label` text/`data-label`. |
| `subdir` | str | output subfolder name (`output/<run>/<subdir>/`) |
| `filename` | `route -> str` | output file name for a route |
| `wait_js` | `route -> str` | JS that resolves when the report is READY **or** empty (post-Generate wait) |
| `is_empty` | `(page) -> bool` | True if the route has no data |
| `save` | `(page, out_path, timeout_ms) -> None` | writes the file |

Each thin `scripts/export_<name>.py` module is ~30 lines: a `SPEC = ReportSpec(...)` plus a `run_cli(SPEC, title=...)` `__main__` for the console flow.

### Save strategies (reusable, in `exporter.py`)

- **`save_pdf_letter(page, out_path, timeout_ms=None)`** -- `page.pdf(format="Letter", print_background=True, margin 0.4in)`. The report is already rendered inline, so `timeout_ms` is unused. Used by Ramp Summary.
- **`save_via_export_button(page, out_path, timeout_ms=None)`** -- clicks `button.export-btn` (`has_text="Export"`, `.first`) and saves the download. Bounds the download wait at `min(download_start_timeout_ms(), ceiling)`; a rendered route whose Export produces no download (the site's no-op for "nothing to export") raises `EmptyExport` in seconds instead of hanging the full ceiling + 15-min retry. If `report_error_text(page)` is set it raises `ReportError` instead. Used by Ramp Detail, Highway Sequence, Highway Log, both Intersection reports.
- **`save_highway_log_pdf(page, out_path, timeout_ms=None)`** -- see [Highway Log (PDF)](#report-4b----highway-log-pdf) below.
- **`save_intersection_detail_pdf(page, out_path, timeout_ms=None)`** -- the Intersection Detail parallel (`intd_printAll`); see [Report 6b](#report-6b----intersection-detail-pdf) below.

Every save calls `_verify_saved_file` (magic-byte integrity check: `.xlsx` must start `PK\x03\x04`, `.pdf` must start `%PDF`; a truncated/0-byte file is deleted and the route fails so resume re-pulls it). See [engine-and-reliability.md](engine-and-reliability.md) for the resume integrity gate.

## Per-report specifics

All `wait_js` predicates also match a no-results phrase so the loop never stalls on an empty route; `is_empty` then decides whether it was empty. `EXPORT_READY_JS` (`common.py`) watches the Export button.

### Report 1 -- TSAR: Ramp Summary (PDF, Letter)
- `label="TSAR: Ramp Summary"`, `subdir="ramp_summary"`, `filename=tsar_ramp_summary_route_<ROUTE>.pdf`.
- Renders **inline**: `wait_js` ready when `Route <route>` appears or `No ramps found`. `is_empty` = `"No ramps found"` in body.
- `save=save_pdf_letter` (inline page -> `page.pdf()` Letter, no Export button click).
- **Source-data caveat (in the consolidator, not the parser).** On **9 routes** (005, 008, 010, 094, 110, 134, 210, 280, 605) the source PDF's own *Ramp Types* breakdown sums short of its stated *Total* by 1-9 ramps, **identically across all three environments**. `consolidate_ramp_summary.parse_pdf` is **correct** -- cross-checked against an independent geometric word-position extraction over all 378 PDFs x 14 ramp types (0 mismatches) and the raw page-2 text. The consolidator's `_audit_ok` cell flags these routes **RED on purpose** (`⚠ Source ≠ total: <section>`). **Do NOT "fix" the parser to force them green** -- that would hide a real TSMIS source-data issue (the cell exists to catch exactly this). The identical gap cancels on both sides of a cross-env comparison. -> [lessons.md](lessons.md) §5.

### Report 1b -- TSAR: Ramp Summary (Excel) (v0.25.1)
- **Same dropdown option as #1** -- `label="TSAR: Ramp Summary"` -- saved as an Excel workbook via the site's Export button instead of capturing the inline page as a PDF. The INVERSE of the print editions: the Excel sibling of a natively-PDF report. Module `export_ramp_summary_excel.py`; `subdir="ramp_summary_excel"`, `filename=tsar_ramp_summary_route_<ROUTE>.xlsx`. The registry's **menu label** is `"TSAR: Ramp Summary (Excel)"` (display only).
- `wait_js` / `is_empty` are identical to the PDF Ramp Summary (inline render; `Route <route>` or `No ramps found`).
- `save=save_via_export_button` -- the action bar's Export button calls the shared `exportToExcel()` dispatcher, which routes `Ramp_Summary` to `rs_exportToExcel()` (an `XLSX.writeFile` download of the count tables). The engine's no-download fast-fail is the empty backstop (`rs_exportToExcel` no-ops without a summary).
- **Consolidate + compare (v0.48.0)** -- `consolidate_ramp_summary_excel` reads the count tables with the SAME record shape as the PDF parser (`parse_xlsx`; the title lines are whitelisted and any unknown row refuses the file as a changed layout) and writes `tsar_ramp_summary_excel_consolidated.xlsx`; its counts equal the PDF edition's on every route of the 2026-10-02 delivery. It compares vs the `ramp_summary` TSN dataset (the same aggregate as #1), between environments, and against the PDF in the Ramp Summary PDF-vs-Excel self-check. Coalesces with #1 automatically (shared `data_value`).

### Report 2 -- TSAR: Ramp Detail (XLSX)
- `label="TSAR: Ramp Detail"`, `subdir="ramp_detail"`, `filename=tsar_ramp_detail_route_<ROUTE>.xlsx`.
- `wait_js` = `EXPORT_READY_JS` or `No ramps found`. `is_empty` = `"No ramps found"` in body.
- `save=save_via_export_button`.
- **Site quirk (cosmetic):** the TSMIS page hardcodes `highway_sequence_listing.xlsx` as Ramp Detail's *download* filename (a site copy-paste bug). Harmless for the tool -- `save_via_export_button` renames the download via `save_as` to the `filename` above. (Worth reporting upstream; tracked in [roadmap.md](roadmap.md).)

### Report 3 -- Highway Sequence Listing (XLSX)
- `label="Highway Sequence Listing"`, `subdir="highway_sequence"`, `filename=highway_sequence_route_<ROUTE>.xlsx`.
- The Export button only renders when the report has data; an empty route shows "No results found" (hsl.js). `wait_js` matches `EXPORT_READY_JS` or the loose `/No \w+ found/i`. `is_empty` keys on that **positive** text — `bool(re.search(r"No \w+ found", body, re.I))` — NOT Export-button absence (Phase-3 fix `highway-sequence-errored-route-can-record-empty`): a fatal error page ALSO lacks the button but renders its message in `#rampResults.error` (caught first by `report_error_text`), not as this text, so button-absence alone would misclassify an errored route as "No data". Locked by `check_export_engine.py`.
- `save=save_via_export_button`.

### Report 4 -- Highway Log (XLSX)
- `label="Highway Log"`, `subdir="highway_log"`, `filename=highway_log_route_<ROUTE>.xlsx`.
- The action bar (with the Export button) ALWAYS renders once the report finishes, even for a route with no rows. `wait_js` = `EXPORT_READY_JS` or `/No results found/i`. `is_empty` = `"No results found"` in body -- detected by table text, NOT button absence (clicking Export on an empty route is a site no-op that would otherwise hang waiting for a download).
- `save=save_via_export_button`.
- Output format / corrected column labels: see [highway_log/columns.md](highway_log/columns.md).

### Report 4b -- Highway Log (PDF)
- **Same dropdown option as #4** -- `label="Highway Log"` -- saved as a PDF via the page's own Print layout instead of the Excel Export button. Module `export_highway_log_pdf.py`; `subdir="highway_log_pdf"`, `filename=highway_log_route_<ROUTE>.pdf`. Letter, **landscape** (30 columns).
- The registry uses a distinct **menu label** `"Highway Log (PDF)"`, but the `ReportSpec`'s `label` stays `"Highway Log"` (the actual dropdown text). The two must not be conflated: `label` is what `select_report` clicks; the menu label is GUI/console display only.
- `wait_js` / `is_empty` are identical to the Excel Highway Log (`EXPORT_READY_JS` or `/No results found/i`; empty = `"No results found"` in body). `is_empty` runs BEFORE save, so the PDF render only runs for routes that actually have rows.
- `save=save_highway_log_pdf`. The on-screen Highway Log is **paginated** (`hl_renderPage` shows one page of rows), so a bare `page.pdf()` would capture a single page. The site's global `hl_printAll()` builds the full multi-page layout (cover page + every page, with page breaks) into `#rampResults`, then calls `window.print()` and SYNCHRONOUSLY restores the on-screen view. The save **overrides `window.print` to raise first** (`window.print = () => { throw ... }`), so that restore line never runs and the complete print layout stays in the DOM for `page.pdf()` (which emulates print media -- the site's `@media print` hides every control and shows only `#rampResults`). It checks `box.querySelector('.hl-print-section')` exists and fails loudly with `ReportError` if `hl_printAll` is missing (`no-print-fn`) or the layout didn't build (`no-layout`), rather than silently saving the one paginated page.
- **Export-only** -- no consolidator on the PDF path itself. The TSMIS Highway Log (PDF) **consolidator** (`consolidate_tsmis_highway_log_pdf.py`) reads this export folder day-aware; see [highway_log/pdf-and-tsn-parsing.md](highway_log/pdf-and-tsn-parsing.md). (Historically the Excel-path consolidator reads the `.xlsx` export.)
- Verified against the real site source + a headless `page.pdf()` fixture (`build/check_fake_site.py`). **Live-export verification against TSMIS is still pending** (the dev PC can't reach the site).

### Reports 5-6 -- Intersection Summary / Intersection Detail (XLSX)
- **Enabled since v0.17.0** (on the **development** site — Settings ▸ "Use development site"). Both
  export, **consolidate, and compare** (cross-environment + vs-TSN) like every other report, and live
  in both matrices. The old app-wide disable gate still EXISTS as defensive groundwork —
  `reports.is_export_disabled()` over `DISABLED_EXPORT_SUBDIRS`,
  `export_reports_status()`'s per-report `disabled` flag, the JS `.option-static` rendering. The set is
  **empty** again as of **v0.19.1** (every export report enabled) — Intersection enabled since v0.17.0,
  the Highway Detail/Summary pair since v0.19.1 (see [Report grouping & site-menu-safe selection](#report-grouping--site-menu-safe-selection-v0181) above). As of P3 the GUI/manifests pass **stable export-op KEYS** (= each
  report's `subdir`; `idx` is display-order metadata only), so a registry re-order never mis-resumes.
  Locked by `build/check_intersection_gate.py` (now registry-derived).
- **Consolidate + compare:** `consolidate_intersection_summary` (category-count summer) and
  `consolidate_intersection_detail` (a thin `consolidate_xlsx` wrapper, sheet "Intersection Detail" —
  header pass-through, so it consolidates whatever shape the run's exports carry) auto-consolidate on
  export finish (both in `_CONSOLIDATOR_BY_SUBDIR`); the vs-TSN + cross-env comparators are wired per
  the registry (see [comparison-engine.md](comparison-engine.md) §9e / §9f). The **PDF edition** of
  Intersection Detail has its own consolidator + comparators (Report 6b).
- **July 2026 format (v0.22.0):** the site reshaped the Intersection Detail export to **35 columns**
  (the duplicated second `ML Eff-Date` dropped; the tail renamed to `Xing P/S` + the NEW
  `Xing Line Lgth`; zero-padded postmiles; native Y/N booleans; historical dates; the Location now
  carries the route suffix). `intersection_detail_columns.HEADER` is the 35-column SoT
  (`DESC_IDX = 20`). The comparators **refuse pre-update consolidated workbooks** (header gate on the
  `Xing Line Lgth` tail) with a re-export hint, and the PDF parser refuses pre-update prints
  (unpadded postmiles) — mis-reading the old 36-column shape by the new positions would silently
  corrupt every column from Description on. Export mechanics (`wait_js`/`is_empty`/save) unchanged.
- Labels + formats verified against the live page source: **NO `"TSAR:"` prefix** (unlike the ramp pair), both Excel via the shared Export button.
- **Intersection Summary**: `label="Intersection Summary"`, `subdir="intersection_summary"`, `filename=intersection_summary_route_<ROUTE>.xlsx`. The page never renders an empty notice -- it ALWAYS shows `Total Intersections = N` (including `= 0`) and always offers a working Export. `wait_js` = `EXPORT_READY_JS` or `.ints-total` present. `is_empty` matches the regex `total intersections\s*=\s*0\b` (a zero total; not `= 10`/`= 20`). No hang risk: a drifted marker just reverts to the old benign all-zeros-file behavior, never a stall.
- **Intersection Detail**: `label="Intersection Detail"`, `subdir="intersection_detail"`, `filename=intersection_detail_route_<ROUTE>.xlsx`. The action bar (Export button) renders even for an empty route, plus an empty table row `<td class="hl-empty">No results found.</td>`. `wait_js` = `EXPORT_READY_JS` or `td.hl-empty` present. `is_empty` = `page.locator("td.hl-empty").count() > 0` (structural, robust to wording drift) OR `"no results found"` in body (text fallback). The engine's general no-download fast-fail (`save_via_export_button` -> `EmptyExport`) is the marker-independent backstop.
- **Caveat:** the site's Intersection feature is still under active development -- its empty strings / DOM are a MOVING TARGET. The fixes key on the robust structural signals (`td.hl-empty`, `Total Intersections = 0`) plus the general empty/no-download fast-fail, and must be re-verified once the feature is finalized. Do not hard-lock to `"No results found."`.

### Report 5b -- Intersection Summary (PDF) (v0.25.1)
- **Same dropdown option as #5** -- `label="Intersection Summary"` -- saved as a PDF via the page's own Print layout. Module `export_intersection_summary_pdf.py`; `subdir="intersection_summary_pdf"`; Letter, **portrait** (count tables, like the native Ramp Summary PDF). The registry's **menu label** is `"Intersection Summary (PDF)"` (display only).
- `wait_js` / `is_empty` are identical to the Excel Intersection Summary (`.ints-total` / `Total Intersections = 0`); `is_empty` runs BEFORE save.
- `save=save_intersection_summary_pdf` (in `exporter.py`). UNLIKE the paginated row reports, the Intersection Summary renders fully INLINE, so the site's `ints_printAll()` merely **prepends a cover page** (`.rs-cover`) to the on-screen report, calls `window.print()`, and restores in an `afterprint` listener. The save overrides `window.print` to raise (no dialog; the afterprint restore never fires), verifies the cover + `.ints-total`, re-reads the total as the marker-independent empty backstop, then `page.pdf()` captures cover + report. In `_PAGE_REBUILDING_SAVES` (the innerHTML reassignment re-creates the Export button), so a coalesced run saves the Excel edition first.
- **Consolidate + compare (v0.48.0)** -- `consolidate_tsmis_intersection_summary_pdf` reads the print's word positions (columns anchored on the `NUMBER` headers, so both the July and the October layouts read) into the Excel edition's exact workbook shape; its counts equal the Excel edition's on every route of the 2026-10-02 delivery. It compares vs the `intersection_summary` TSN dataset, between environments, and against the Excel edition in its PDF-vs-Excel self-check. Coalesces with #5 automatically (shared `data_value`).

### Report 6b -- Intersection Detail (PDF)

The exact parallel of Report 4b (Highway Log (PDF)), forward-ported in v0.18.0 (CR-002).
- **Same dropdown option as #6** -- `label="Intersection Detail"` -- saved as a PDF via the page's own Print layout instead of the Excel Export button. Module `export_intersection_detail_pdf.py`; `subdir="intersection_detail_pdf"`; Letter, **landscape**. The registry's **menu label** is `"Intersection Detail (PDF)"`, but the `ReportSpec`'s `label` stays `"Intersection Detail"` (the dropdown text `select_report` clicks) — the two must not be conflated.
- **Appended LAST** in the export catalog so the seven existing export-op keys keep positions 0–6 — the manifest-v1 integer-index compatibility contract (CR-002-RM4; `batch_manifest._V017_EXPORT_ORDER` index 7 = `intersection_detail_pdf`).
- `wait_js` / `is_empty` are identical to the Excel Intersection Detail (`td.hl-empty` / `"no results found"`); `is_empty` runs BEFORE save, so the PDF render only runs for routes with rows.
- `save=save_intersection_detail_pdf` (in `exporter.py`) — the same print-capture mechanism as `save_highway_log_pdf`: the site's `intd_printAll()` builds the full multi-page layout, `window.print` is overridden to raise so the on-screen restore never runs, then `page.pdf()` captures it; it fails loudly with `ReportError` if the print fn or layout is missing.
- **Consolidator:** `consolidate_tsmis_intersection_detail_pdf.py` parses the PDF route exports into the SAME 35-column July-2026 format (`intersection_detail_columns.HEADER`, Description at index 20) as the Excel export — a two-row-per-record / zebra-shaded PDF parser (both grids from the shaded records' own 21/18-cell bands; rowA = zero-padded postmile, rowB = the print-only integer intersection number, discarded; the vestigial 21st rowA column is warned about if it ever grows data back; pre-update prints are refused with a re-export hint). Current 7.9 statewide parity proof vs the same-pull Excel: 217/217 routes, 16,459/16,459 rows, 0 orphans across 1,844 PDF pages, and exactly nine typed cell differences — eight Excel Description cells with trailing tabs the PDF cannot render plus one HG source conflict at `108/TUO/5.870` where PDF and both TSN forms agree against Excel. Every nonblank typed consolidation cell, explicit member Route, and physical `S` claim is exact. Like HL-PDF it is NOT auto-consolidated inline (it needs a scratch convert dir — the matrix handles it). **Comparators:** `compare_intersection_detail_pdf` — `TSMIS_PDF_VS_TSN` + `TSMIS_PDF_VS_EXCEL`, reusing the Excel Intersection Detail's vs-TSN schema/loaders.
- Verified offline against the fake-site fixture (`build/check_intersection_detail_pdf.py`, `build/fake_site/intersection_detail_print.html`) and source-bound end to end against the current 217+217 `All Reports 7.9` ARS-prod pair. The accepted source oracle is `ID-79` in `docs/planning/comparison-perfection/comparison-canary-bindings.md`; product parser/identity/Report-View findings remain open and are not excused by source-projection acceptance.

## Report grouping & site-menu-safe selection (v0.18.1)

These contracts track the grouped report menu and two-mode route form present in the 2026-08 production and development sessions.

### Selecting a report by stable `data_value`, not visible text

The newer `#customReport` surface uses nested **`cs-parent` → `cs-submenu`** fly-outs, where a leaf's visible text may be only **"Detail" / "Summary"**, the full name sits in `data-label`, and the report's stable id sits in **`data-value`** (the hidden native `<select>` value). Older captures use flat `li.cs-option` rows. Matching by visible text alone breaks on the grouped form because a leaf reads "Detail", not "Intersection Detail".

`report_nav._find_exact_option(page, label, data_value=None)` matches by **`data-value` first** (exactly one hit wins), falling back to exact `text` / `data-label` for older flat menus and rollback builds. `_reveal_submenu_if_leaf` hovers the option's `cs-parent` ancestor to open the CSS-only fly-out before clicking. `select_report` / `preflight` thread the spec's `data_value` through; the env-scan probe (`gui_worker._REPORT_OPTIONS_JS` + `check_one`) follows the same rule and weighs the parent fly-out's disabled class. Locked by the authored `build/fake_site/dropdown_nested.html` fixture (driven by `check_fake_site` + `check_export_engine`); every `ReportSpec` carries its `data_value`. The `cs-disabled` rule below is unchanged.

The form controls use stable structural IDs too. The 2026-08 site added postmile `#pm-district` while retaining District/Route `#districtSelect`; both are labelled **District**, so accessible-label lookup is ambiguous. Selection therefore switches mode with `#modeBtnDistrictRoute`, fans out through `#districtSelect` / `#districtCountySelect`, and generates routes with `#districtRouteSelect` / `#districtRouteBtn`. Labels remain display text, not selector identity. The browser regression is `test_duplicate_district_labels` in `build/check_fake_site.py`.

### The picker is grouped like the website

The GUI report picker mirrors the site's own grouping: **flat** Highway Log, Highway Log (PDF), Highway Sequence, Highway Sequence (PDF) and the greyed Route History Table at the top (the site's order), then the **Ramp** and **Intersection** families under their own headings. Order + grouping are catalog-driven, not UI-hardcoded: each `ExportEntry` carries an optional `group` + `short_label`, and `report_catalog._PICKER_ORDER` (exposed as `picker_order()`, import-asserted to cover every export key) fixes the display sequence. `reports.PICKER_ORDER` / `EXPORT_DISPLAY` re-export them; `gui_api` sorts the `reports` payload by `PICKER_ORDER` and sets each entry's `idx` = its **display position** (no app code reads `idx` — it's parity-check metadata only), plus `group` and `short` (the short leaf label, e.g. "Detail"). `ui/app.js` emits an `.option-group` header on each group change and shows `short || label` (indented under its group). Both the Export picker and Export-Everything use the one `fillReportList()`.

### Highway Detail / Highway Summary — both INTEGRATED (Detail v0.20.0, Summary v0.37.0)

The site added two more TSAR reports, **Highway Detail** and **Highway Summary**. v0.18.1 scaffolded them as reserved-DISABLED groundwork; **v0.19.1 enabled their EXPORT**; **v0.19.2 added the Highway Detail print-layout PDF edition**; **v0.20.0 integrated Highway Detail end-to-end** (consolidators + vs-TSN / cross-env / PDF↔Excel comparators + TSN library entry + both matrices — see the Highway Detail family section below); **v0.37.0 integrated Highway Summary** off the vendor's 2026-08-17 release (consolidator + cross-env comparator + matrix row — everything but vs-TSN, which has no source yet):

- **Real modules** `export_highway_detail.py` / `export_highway_summary.py` — each a genuine `ReportSpec` modeled on the Excel siblings (`save = save_via_export_button`). Confirmed against the **7.7 dev capture** (`highway_detail.js` live, action bar wires `hd_exportToExcel()` + `hd_printAll()`): empty = `td.hl-empty` / "No results found in this segment.", matched loosely (`td.hl-empty` OR "No … found"). Highway Detail was un-greyed on 7.7 and Highway Summary was still `cs-disabled` there (its export fail-fasted with `ReportUnavailableError`); **the vendor released BOTH on 2026-08-17**, so neither greys now.
- **Highway Detail (PDF)** — `export_highway_detail_pdf.py`, `subdir="highway_detail_pdf"`, `data_value="highway_detail"` (same dropdown option), `save=save_highway_detail_pdf` (in `exporter.py`). The twin of `save_highway_log_pdf`: `hd_printAll()` builds the SAME `.hl-print-section` print layout; `window.print` is overridden to raise so the on-screen restore never runs, then `page.pdf()` captures it (Letter, **landscape**, 27 roadbed-grouped columns). Empty backstop counts `.hd-row1` data rows (HD's grouped columns put colspan on real rows, so Highway Log's non-colspan heuristic doesn't apply). **Appended LAST** — stable id **10** (`batch_manifest._V017_EXPORT_ORDER` stays `== EXPORT_KEYS`); `_PICKER_ORDER` places it next to its Excel sibling.
- **The export gate holds one reserved placeholder** (`reports.DISABLED_EXPORT_SUBDIRS = {'route_history'}`): Route History (stable id 15) has no export flow, so it's greyed; every OTHER report — the Clean Road Files trio (ids 16/17/18) included since 2026-09-02 — is pickable in the Export picker and ticked in Export Everything. Where the **live site** still `cs-disabled`s a report, `select_report` fails fast instead of stalling.
- **Highway Detail** consolidates + compares like every other report as of **v0.20.0**; **Highway Summary** joined Consolidate, Compare and the env matrix in **v0.37.0**; the nine editions that were still export-only (Ramp Summary Excel, Intersection Summary PDF, Highway Summary PDF and the six Clean Road editions) joined in **v0.48.0** (the env matrix is 22 rows). Locked by `check_intersection_gate` (empty gate), `check_report_recipe`, `check_stable_ids` (append-only 8/9/10), `check_report_catalog`, and `check_report_wiring`.

Highway Summary's vs-TSN leg landed in **v0.37.0** and is the clearest proof the plug-in contract works as documented: adding `compare_highway_summary_tsn` + `tsn_load_highway_summary`, a `cmp:highway_summary:tsn` COMPARE entry, a `report_catalog.TSN` descriptor, and `tsn_key` on the existing `MatrixEntry` was the WHOLE change — `matrix.tsn_supported()` and `day_matrix._day_rows()` flipped the row's cells on by themselves, with no per-report special case anywhere.

### Highway Summary — the miles-measured aggregate (v0.37.0)

Highway Summary is the app's first **miles-measured** aggregate report. Its per-route export is not a row-per-record table but a fixed statistics document: a `TOTAL MILES SELECTED` scalar, then 10 category sections, each a `Code | Miles` block.

**Censused on the 2026-08-17 statewide prod release** (`ground-truth/HD + HS Release 8.17/`, 252 routes): ONE skeleton across every file — same sheet name (`Highway Summary`), same 129×2 shape, same section order, the same 95 code rows, values numeric with at most three decimals. Statewide total **17,301.098 miles**.

- **`highway_summary_columns.py`** is the layout SoT: the ordered sections/codes, and the ONE strict reader (`values_from_rows`) that the consolidator AND the cross-environment loader both go through — the CMP-AUD-018 rule, so two paths can't read differently and let two equally-broken sides certify a clean match. Miles are carried as exact integer **thousandths** (the export prints three decimals), so statewide rollups sum exactly instead of drifting in binary float.
- **`summary_layout` gained an opt-in MEASURE mode** (v0.37.0, when the TSN print arrived the same day): `value_reader` / `value_format` / `measure_noun` let the shared familiar-sheet renderer carry fractional miles, and `check_compare_highway_summary_tsn` asserts the two COUNT specs are untouched by it. Before the TSN side existed, Highway Summary deliberately did NOT go through it — forcing a measure concept through correctness-locked count code with no consumer would have bought nothing.
- **The tripwire is the skeleton, and it is exact.** A renamed section, an unknown/dropped/duplicated code, a reordered section, a missing or duplicated total, or an over-precise value fails that route loudly naming the difference. Whitespace and case drift are tolerated (cosmetic, not identity). `build/check_highway_summary_layout.py` proves each refusal fires, hermetically (synthesized sheets, no corpus needed).
- **Partitions are BOUNDED, not exact.** Nine sections tabulate a subset of the route total; `NON-ADD` is independent (non-add mileage, never the total). A section summing ABOVE the total is refused. Summing BELOW is real and measured — six routes on the release (`HIGHWAY GROUP` on 099/101/125/170/905, `MEDIAN TYPE` on 099/101/170/180, `NUMBER OF LANES` on 101) — so the residual is exposed as a note, never redistributed into a category.
- **A zero-total route is NOT empty.** Four routes (010S/014U/015S/178S) report `TOTAL MILES SELECTED = 0` while carrying real NON-ADD mileage (0.692–18.785 miles) and 10–102 Highway Detail records each: the total tabulates ADD mileage only. `record_has_data` therefore counts ANY non-zero measure — keying on the total alone dropped four real routes and pinned every run to PARTIAL.
- **Output:** `highway_summary_consolidated.xlsx` — sheet `Highway Summary` (one row per route: Route, Total Miles, 95 category columns = 97 wide) plus `Combined`, the familiar section-grouped statewide rollup carrying the bounded-residual notes.
- **Cross-env** rides the `side_loader` + `agg_header` aggregate path (the Intersection Summary pattern), keyed on route, with `agg_header` = the consolidator's own header so compared columns and workbook columns cannot drift.

#### vs TSN (v0.37.0) — the third aggregate summary, the first measuring miles

`compare_highway_summary_tsn` reduces each side to ONE statewide {category: miles} table and compares it with `has_route=False`, exactly like Ramp / Intersection Summary. `tsn_load_highway_summary` normalizes the statewide print into the library's `[Category, Miles]` workbook.

**The print's censused conventions** (`ground-truth/Highway Summary TSN print 9.15/`, OTM22230, event 4843734, reference 09/15/2025):

- **Two columns of independent little tables.** Each section prints `<---NAME--->` then its own `DVM CODE MILES` header. A section's REGION is its header's x-span widened to the midpoints between horizontal neighbours sharing a y-band, running down to the next section sharing its x-band. **Rows are clustered INSIDE a region, never page-wide** — the two columns' baselines interleave, so a page-wide cluster steals a code line into its neighbour's row and orphans its MILES value (this cost `L-LEFT IND ALIGN` its mileage in the first draft).
- **The MILES header is NOT right-aligned with its data** (header x1 260.9 vs data 276.6), so the column header's edge is useless as an anchor — the region is.
- **The DVM figure is frequently GLUED to the code text** (`6,311,760.663R-RIGHT IND ALIGN`, and even to a range: `111,826,634.85960 - 99`) and is stripped. TSMIS does not tabulate Daily Vehicle Miles, so DVM is never compared.
- **MEDIAN TYPE labels carry an old-system mapping in parentheses** (`B-STRIPED (S )`), stripped for matching.
- **RURAL-URBAN prints its `- O - OUTSIDE CITY` rows without the parent letter**, so each binds to the preceding `R-RURAL` / `U-URBAN` row (the CMP-AUD-023 rule); a parentless `-O` carrying a value RAISES rather than defaulting to Rural.
- **`**********` means the value overflowed its column width** — an ABSENT source fact, not a zero. It is omitted so the category shows one-sided (CMP-AUD-021), and the normalized workbook reports PARTIAL naming it. On the bound print that is exactly `MEDIAN BARRIER: Z- NO BARRIER`.

**Pairing is on the within-section CODE, not the label**, because the two systems spell everything differently (`R- RIGHT  IND ALIGN` vs `R-RIGHT IND ALIGN`; `0  -  4` vs `0 - 4`). `highway_summary_columns` derives the code for each TSMIS label and asserts uniqueness within every section.

**Structurally one-sided, by design** — 4 of 95, all measured: `MEDIAN TYPE (UNDIVIDED)` / `(DIVIDED)` (group sub-headers the export writes as 0 on all 252 routes and the print does not measure), `DESIGN SPEED - NO DATA` (the print has no such row, though MEDIAN WIDTH does), and the masked `MEDIAN BARRIER Z- NO BARRIER`.

**`TOTAL MILES SELECTED` is NOT like-for-like** and the familiar sheet says so: the print's own footnotes exclude non-add and unconstructed mileage, and its figures bear that out (Highway Group sums to exactly the total PLUS its unconstructed). The TSMIS export applies no such exclusion. Measured on the bound pair: TSMIS reports **0.000** unconstructed miles statewide, TSN **1,289.296**.

**Bound result** (2026-08-17 TSMIS export vs the 2025-09-15 print — ~11 months apart, so most mileage legitimately moved): **92 categories in both, 0 TSN-only, 4 TSMIS-only, 89 differing / 3 identical**. The familiar `Summary by Category` sheet renders miles to three decimals via `summary_layout`'s opt-in measure mode.

### Highway Summary (PDF) — the print edition (export v0.38.0, the rest v0.48.0)

`export_highway_summary_pdf.py` saves the SAME "Highway Summary" dropdown option through
the site's own Print layout instead of the Excel Export button — the exact parallel of
Intersection Summary (PDF). Verified against the 2026-08-10 site capture
(`highway_summary.js`): the action bar wires `hs_exportToExcel()` + `hs_printAll()`, and
`hs_printAll()` PREPENDS a cover page (`.rs-cover.hs-cover`, code `OTM22230`) to the
inline section tables then calls the shared `printWithTitle('highway_summary')`, which is
a `document.title` swap plus `window.print()`.

- **`save_highway_summary_pdf`** overrides `window.print` to raise FIRST, so no print
  dialog opens, the `afterprint` restore never fires, and the cover + report stay in the
  DOM for `page.pdf()`. Narrow two-column code/miles tables → **Portrait**.
- **The empty backstop is NOT "total = 0".** Unlike Intersection Summary, a zero total is
  a legitimate Highway Summary: four routes on the 2026-08-17 release (010S / 014U / 015S
  / 178S) report `TOTAL MILES SELECTED = 0` while carrying real NON-ADD mileage. The
  marker-independent backstop is instead "the cover built but no `.hs-code` section row
  rendered".
- **Shares the Excel edition's `data_value`, `wait_js` and `is_empty`**, so selecting both
  editions coalesces (one render, two files) and the two can never disagree about whether
  a route had data.
- **Consolidate + compare (v0.48.0).** The vendor's 2026-08-17 release delivered the
  Excel edition only; the 2026-10-02 statewide delivery brought the first real prints
  (252 routes). `consolidate_tsmis_highway_summary_pdf` reads each print's word
  positions — sections by their printed names, the `CODE` column as the anchor, the
  cover's `ROUTE` line as the route claim — into the Excel edition's exact 97-column
  workbook, so both editions share the miles reader's rules: an unknown, duplicated
  or missing category refuses the file. Two print-only shapes are handled by name:
  RURAL-URBAN's `- O -` rows bind to the `R-`/`U-` row above them, and the
  `MEDIAN TYPE (UNDIVIDED)` / `(DIVIDED)` group headers (printed without a figure)
  read as `0.000`, exactly what the Excel edition writes. The miles equal the Excel
  edition's on all 252 routes. It compares vs the `highway_summary` TSN dataset,
  between environments, and against the Excel edition in its PDF-vs-Excel self-check —
  the same sequence Highway Sequence (PDF) and Ramp Detail (PDF) followed.

### The Highway Detail family (v0.20.0)

Built on the Intersection Detail recipe, verified against the full statewide dev bundle (252 TSMIS routes / 51,243 rows; the 60,083-row statewide TSN extract; all 12 TSN district PDFs cross-checked ≥99.9% field-identical against the extract):

- **`highway_detail_columns.py`** — the 34-column labels SoT (the export's own labels are CORRECT, unlike Highway Log's) + legend meanings, hover tooltips, a Legend sheet, and `recognize()`.
- **`consolidate_highway_detail.py`** — a thin `consolidate_xlsx` wrapper (sheet `"Highway Detail"`, Route column prepended, tooltips + Legend). Auto-consolidates on export finish (`_AUTO_CONSOLIDATOR`).
- **`consolidate_tsmis_highway_detail_pdf.py`** — parses the app's own **Highway Detail (PDF)** export into the SAME 34-column format via `pdf_table_lib`. The print layout is TWO physical lines per record with DIFFERENT geometry (line 1 = 10 cells, line 2 = 25 cells), so TWO window sets are derived from the zebra-shaded bands; DCR group rows (`11 IMP 007`) and page furniture never match the line-1 postmile test. Orphan reconciliation escalates to a producer-owned PARTIAL. **v0.26.0 (the July-print census, off the first real prod set):** line 2 is now "whatever follows the line 1 except the censused furniture" — the old "always carries a TASAS date" rule dropped real records whose roadbed blocks print codes without effective dates, and pages whose grid splits a date across windows; `_is_line1` requires the postmile ALONE (or PM+Length on the fallback grid), so an outdented equate DESCRIPTION starting with a PM-shaped token no longer minted phantom records; a record whose print carries NO second line is kept with a blank attribute tail (`single_line` in stats, an FYI note — not PARTIAL).
- **`tsn_load_highway_detail.py` + the `TsnEntry`** — normalizes the statewide 56-column `TSAR - HIGHWAY DETAIL` Excel extract (`statewide_xlsx`, `normalization_version=2`) into `Highway Detail (TSN)` = `["Route"] + SHARED_HEADER + SIDECAR_HEADER` (v2 appends the TSN District/County sidecar the visual-evidence generator reads; the comparison loader slices to the shared width). The TSN **district PDFs** were verified consistent with the extract and stay reference-only for the comparison — dropped into `tsn_library/highway_detail/pdf/` they feed the evidence images.
- **`compare_highway_detail_tsn.py`** — the FLAT vs-TSN comparator (route + **canonical Post Mile** key). The key unifies the two systems' roadbed encodings (TSMIS glues R/L onto the PM, `'000.080R'`; TSN prints a bare PM with `HG∈{R,L}`) and EXCLUDES the equation marker (the systems disagree on where they print `E` — it is compared as the separate **PS** column instead). Normalizations (each documented in the workbook's **Notes** sheet): TSN `NON_ADD 'A'` ≡ blank, zero-padding (`'02'`≡`'2'`), Length to the printed 3 decimals, `M_WID`+`M_VA` glued to `'14Z'`, whitespace collapse. `RU Eff` is compared BY POSITION against TSN's `BEG_DATE` (the legacy report's ADT begin-date slot — different semantics, differs on ~99% of rows, documented, soft in the Report View). The TSN-only ADT block + `*`/`Y` change flags are not compared (ADT shows in blue on the **Report View**, the printed two-line TASAS replica with Major/Diffs counts).
- **`compare_highway_detail_pdf.py`** — `TSMIS_PDF_VS_TSN` + `TSMIS_PDF_VS_EXCEL` (the export-correctness self-check), the exact `compare_intersection_detail_pdf` parallel.
- **`visual_evidence.py` + `evidence_highway_detail.py`** (v0.21.0) — the OPTIONAL **evidence images** decoration of the vs-TSN comparisons: for every differing column, sampled random rows rendered as highlighted snippets from BOTH PDFs (the app's (PDF) export + the TSN district prints), each example verified by parse-back before it's shown; `… (evidence).xlsx` + a two-layout image folder beside the comparison. Toggle + per-column count (1–10) on both matrix pages. → [comparison-engine.md](comparison-engine.md) §13.

### Highway Sequence (PDF) — the fully-integrated print edition (export v0.24.0, the rest v0.25.0)

Cloned from the Highway Detail (PDF) recipe; the export was confirmed on BOTH site
captures (main `website-source` + `TSMIS Dev Site 7.7`), and the parser/comparisons/
evidence were **censused-first and blessed on the first real work-PC print set**
(`ground-truth/HSL PDF + IS Bundle 7.9`, 252 routes — parse-back 60,493/60,493 rows vs
the 7.8 Excel exports; every residual class explained):

- **`export_highway_sequence_pdf.py`** — `subdir="highway_sequence_pdf"`,
  `data_value="highway_sequence"` (same dropdown option as the Excel sibling),
  `save=save_highway_sequence_pdf`. The site's `hsl_printAll()` builds a cover page + legend
  page + per-district `.hsl-print-table` sections (9 columns); the save overrides
  `window.print` to raise, calls it, counts non-colspan tbody rows as the empty backstop,
  and captures **PORTRAIT** Letter — matching the TSN district prints (612×792).
- **`consolidate_tsmis_highway_sequence_pdf.py`** — parses the per-route prints into the
  SAME 9-column TSMIS format the Excel export produces (header-anchored per-page windows;
  the postmile prefix/suffix in their two unnamed columns). The censused conventions:
  wrapped Descriptions cluster as fragment lines around a vertically-centered data line
  (top-order, HYPHEN-AWARE rejoin — `join_desc_parts`); a few rows carry NO postmile
  ("END OF ROUTE …", "CITY END: …" — matched by their single-letter HG+FT windows);
  EQUATES print the TSN way (annotation row "EQUATES TO <label>" with HG/FT/Distance
  blank + the `E` suffix on the equated plain postmile — the Excel export seats them
  differently BY DESIGN); the last page ends with an "Unresolved Intersections"
  site-diagnostics trailer (hard stop). Values written verbatim; unparsed lines escalate
  to a producer-owned PARTIAL.
- **`compare_highway_sequence_pdf.py`** — `TSMIS_PDF_VS_TSN` + `TSMIS_PDF_VS_EXCEL`, the
  `compare_highway_detail_pdf` parallel riding `compare_highway_sequence_tsn`'s loaders +
  schema, each flavor with its OWN Notes sheet. The print's TSN-style equates meant
  PDF-vs-TSN paired BETTER than Excel-vs-TSN (same-run 7.9 canary: both 57,505 vs Excel's
  57,072) until CMP-AUD-246 (2026-09-02) seated the Excel export's equate suffix the TSN
  way before keying — Excel-vs-TSN now pairs 57,518, PDF-vs-TSN is untouched — while PDF-vs-Excel
  compares the two renders' representation classes directly — **60,493 paired / 0 PDF-only /
  1 Excel-only; asserted 1,410 rows / 3,721 cells (Desc 1,133, FT 1,129, HG 910, PM Suffix
  549)**. The v0.25.0 self-check's "route 037 dropped Description" was later proven a
  CROSS-BUNDLE artifact (a 7.8 Excel read against a 7.9 print; the same-run Excel carries
  it — CMP-AUD-193), and the same-run pair's real residual is five unrepresented
  Description claims, kept visible. See [tsn-parsers.md](tsn-parsers.md).
- **`evidence_highway_sequence.py`** (v0.25.0) — evidence images for BOTH Highway
  Sequence rows: the highway-log pattern (per-print SENTINEL routing — HSL rows carry no
  district; records carry their own src/dist/cnty from the prints' "DIST NN RTE NNN"
  group headers), diffs judged via `compare_core.compared_cell` so the CONTEXT columns
  (HG/City/Distance) can never enumerate. TSN prints read from
  `tsn_library/highway_sequence/raw/` — the SAME files the TSN library builds from (the
  `_TSN_PDFS_IN_RAW` pattern; no duplicate drop).
- Matrix rows in BOTH matrices (env + vs TSN + vs TSMIS Excel modes; shares the
  `highway_sequence` TSN dataset with its Excel sibling); `cons:highway_sequence_pdf` on
  the Consolidate tab + the console menu. Locked by `check_report_catalog`,
  `check_matrix_tsn`, `check_visual_evidence` (+ the mock parity checks).

### Ramp Detail (PDF) — the fully-integrated print edition (export v0.24.0, the rest v0.26.0)

The last export-only print edition graduated exactly the Highway Sequence (PDF) way:
censused-first and blessed on the first real work-PC print set
(`ground-truth/All Reports 7.9`, 126 routes — parse-back **15,216/15,216 rows**
route-for-row against the SAME-DAY Excel exports; zero unclassified lines, zero stray
fragments, every residual cell class explained):

- **`export_ramp_detail_pdf.py`** — `subdir="ramp_detail_pdf"`, `data_value="Ramp_Detail"`,
  `save=save_ramp_detail_pdf`. Ramp Detail has **no `rd_printAll`**: its print body IS the
  site's shared async `printAll()` dispatcher, which first `await`s a
  `showPrompt('Enter report title:')` modal. The save overrides BOTH globals —
  `window.print` raises, `showPrompt` resolves immediately with a route-derived title (no
  modal ever opens) — and awaits the dispatcher under a `Promise.race` bound
  (`_RAMP_DETAIL_PRINT_BUILD_MS`) so a future unanswered await fails the route loudly
  instead of hanging it. Captures **LANDSCAPE** Letter (the TSN statewide Ramp Detail print
  is 792×612). Marker `.rd-print-table` (11 columns). Stable ids 11/12 (with Highway
  Sequence (PDF)); coalesces with its Excel sibling (shared `data_value`).
- **`consolidate_tsmis_ramp_detail_pdf.py`** — parses the per-route prints into the Excel
  export's EXACT layout (its column-shifted header included, so the combined workbook is
  position-compatible with the Excel-consolidated one) **plus the two PRINT-ONLY columns
  the Excel export drops** — the On/Off indicator (N/F/Z) and the Ramp Type letter —
  appended after it with real labels. Header-anchored per-page word windows (the three
  single-letter header columns located BETWEEN the multi-letter anchors, never by bare
  text); Descriptions never wrapped statewide (the fragment machinery is kept as a loud
  safety net); the print renders EMPTY fields visibly ("-" in Area 4 / On/Off, the
  Description message "NO RAMP LINEAR EVENT" — 59 statewide rows, the ramp points
  without linework Ramp Summary counts). Values written verbatim; unparsed lines escalate
  to a producer-owned PARTIAL.
- **`compare_ramp_detail_pdf.py`** — `TSMIS_PDF_VS_TSN` + `TSMIS_PDF_VS_EXCEL`, riding
  `compare_ramp_detail_tsn`'s locked schema via `dataclasses.replace`, each flavor with
  its OWN Notes sheet. The PDF flavors project the censused render artifacts at compare
  time (the workbook stays verbatim): Description whitespace runs collapse on BOTH sides
  (the database — so the Excel export AND the TSN extract — carries literal double
  spaces the HTML print collapses), the null-render tokens project to blank, and the
  print's On/Off letters (N/F/Z) project to TSN's (O/F/Z). **On/Off + Ramp Type GRADUATE
  from context to compared in the PDF-vs-TSN flavor** — the print carries data the Excel
  export doesn't, so the PDF side verifies two more columns against TSN (Ramp Name/ADT
  stay context; the Excel flavor and the PDF↔Excel check keep all four context).
  PDF↔Excel on the same-day statewide pair: **both 15,216, one-sided 0/0, 15,212 fully
  identical** — the only 4 differing cells are the Excel's literal `_x000d_` line-break
  escapes (route 010's rest-area ramps) the print omits, the same honest class HSL's
  self-check carries.
- **`evidence_ramp_detail.py`** — evidence images for BOTH Ramp Detail rows: the
  Intersection Detail pattern on the TSN side (ONE statewide TASAS print, fixed column
  template — header anchors pixel-identical across its 500 pages, censused 400/400
  records against the raw extract — indexed once per file and cached) + the
  consolidator-LOCKSTEP word-window locator on the TSMIS side. The adapter serves the
  two rows' DIFFERENT compared sets (the consolidated workbook names its source — the
  PDF-consolidated carries the "On/Off" header — so the Excel row never enumerates the
  print-only columns). The RD TSN library gained the District/County sidecar
  (`tsn_load_ramp_detail`, normalization **v3**, split from LOCATION "01-DN-101"; D2
  auto-rebuild); the TSN print lives in `tsn_library/ramp_detail/pdf/` (the
  statewide-XLSX-sourced pattern, like Intersection Detail). Known skip-classes recorded
  honestly: the TSN print TRUNCATES long Descriptions; on the Excel row the compared
  Description keeps the database's double spaces the print collapses.
- Matrix rows in BOTH matrices (env + vs TSN + vs TSMIS Excel modes; shares the
  `ramp_detail` TSN dataset with its Excel sibling); `cons:ramp_detail_pdf` on the
  Consolidate tab + the console menu. Locked by `check_report_catalog`,
  `check_matrix_tsn`, `check_visual_evidence` (+ the mock parity checks).

### Route History Table — reserved, app-wide DISABLED (v0.25.1)

The dev site added a **"Route History Table"** report on 2026-07-09 (`data_value="route_history"`, a flat top-level option). It is NOT a query report: selecting it drops into an **embedded SSRS report** (`route_history.js` iframes the TSN report server; District/County/Route/Date are picked in the SSRS parameter panel), with **no export control** — nothing for the engine to drive. The app wires it as **reserved-DISABLED groundwork** (the exact v0.18.1 Highway-pair path): `export_route_history.py` holds a minimal placeholder spec (its `save` raises loudly if ever reached), stable id **15** is reserved (`batch_manifest` appended), and `reports.DISABLED_EXPORT_SUBDIRS = {"route_history"}` shows it **greyed** in the picker while the start guards reject its key server-side. If the site later gives Route History an export flow: write the real save, empty the gate, and update `check_intersection_gate`'s `_RESERVED`.

### Clean Road Files (Highway / Intersection / Ramp) — export ENABLED (2026-09-02)

The dev site's **"Clean Road Files"** group (`data_value` `clean_highway` / `clean_intersection` / `clean_ramp`; stable ids **16/17/18**, reserved 2026-07-22) went live on the **9.1 dev capture** (`site-captures/TSMIS Dev Site 9.1/`, BUILD_DATE 2026-08-19): the three options lost `cs-disabled` and the site ships `clean_highway.js` / `clean_intersection.js` / `clean_ramp.js`. Each is a flat, one-row-per-record replica of the legacy TASAS clean-road CSV with the **full** legacy header — 74 `THY_*` / 55 `INX_*` / 34 `RAM_*` columns (the first two are exactly the TSN `CA HIGHWAYS` / `CA INTERSECTIONS` headers; Ramp is TSN's 32 plus `RAM_HPMS_ID` + `RAM_RAMP_ROUTE_NAME`); columns the site has no layer source for stay present and blank (22 / 10 / 13 of them) — rendered into `#rampResults` through the shared action bar, so `export_clean_road.py` carries three genuine Excel-sibling `ReportSpec`s:

- `label` = the site's `data-label` ("Clean Road File Highway" …), `data_value` = the stable id; `subdir` = the id, `filename` = `<id>_route_<ROUTE>.xlsx`. The options are FLAT `cs-option cs-sub` rows under a `cs-header` — indented, but NOT fly-out leaves — so `select_report` needs no submenu reveal (`check_fake_site` covers the shape, including the visible text "Highway" coinciding with a TSAR fly-out parent's).
- `wait_js` = `EXPORT_READY_JS` OR the empty marker; `is_empty` = the structural `#rampResults .ramp-empty` (`*_showResults('none')` renders `<span class="ramp-empty">No results found in this segment.</span>` with NO action bar) with the loose "No … found" text as the fallback; `save = save_via_export_button` (`clh_/cli_/clr_exportToExcel()` → a client-side `XLSX.writeFile`, one sheet "Clean Road Highway" / "… Intersection" / "… Ramp"; the engine's no-download fast-fail is the backstop).
- The reports reuse the site's Highway Log / Intersection Detail / Ramp Detail query pipelines — Clean Highway runs the WHOLE Highway Log builder plus four extra layer lookups (functional class 91, forest 115, `SegOrderId` 122, route breaks 133) — so expect **Highway-Log-class run times**, not Ramp-Detail ones.
- **Print editions.** The site's `*_printAll()` print editions (landscape, cover page, scale-to-fit) are wired since **v0.45.2** (`clean_<kind>_pdf`, stable ids 20/21/22; `exporter._save_clean_road_pdf` neutralizes `window.print`, keeps the `.clh-print-root` layout, writes Letter landscape at the site's 0.35in `@page` margins, and raises EmptyExport when the print body has no rows). Each shares its Excel sibling's `data_value`, so ticking both coalesces into one render.
- **Consolidate + compare since v0.48.0** — both editions, off the 2026-10-02 statewide delivery: see [Clean Road site exports](#clean-road-site-exports--consolidate-and-compare-v0480) below. The app's OWN builds of all three files live on the ArcGIS tab (footnote 7 above): the CA HIGHWAYS workbook and, since **v0.50.0**, the Clean Road Intersection and Ramp files, which follow the site's own pipelines. All three are ROWS of that tab's Reports vs ArcGIS matrix (`arcgis_reports.py`), both editions each, compared with the site's export ([comparison-engine.md](comparison-engine.md) §9n).
- **Verified offline against the REAL captured site source, not only fixtures:** the shipped `select_report` was driven over every dropdown option on the 9.1 capture (each arms, County fans to ALL, Route + Generate present) and on the 8.10 capture (the five reports greyed there raise `ReportUnavailableError`); on 9.1, Generate with every ArcGIS query stubbed empty renders the `.ramp-empty` state each spec recognises. Live data and the download are work-PC only (roadmap B1).

### Clean Road site exports — consolidate and compare (v0.48.0)

The 2026-10-02 statewide delivery (`ground-truth/All Reports 10.2`) carried both
editions of all three Clean Road files, which turned the census Lesson 13 asks for into
real material. `clean_road_columns.py` is the column contract for both editions: the
site's sheet names, the full TASAS headers (74 / 55 / 34), the columns the site has no
source for (22 / 10 / 13 — present, blank, and printed nowhere), and each report's
route / county / postmile columns.

- **Excel editions** (`consolidate_clean_road_highway` / `_intersection` / `_ramp`)
  consolidate like every flat report: `clean_road_<kind>_consolidated.xlsx`, Route +
  the full header, one row per record. They auto-consolidate on export finish.
- **PDF editions** (`consolidate_tsmis_clean_<kind>_pdf`) are read by
  `clean_road_print.py` with **pypdfium2**, because the print is one scaled-to-fit
  HTML table whose type is tiny (Highway prints at 1.4–1.7 pt). The reader takes the
  cover's `LOCATION CRITERIA: ROUTE <r>` line as the route claim (reconciled against
  the file name, CMP-AUD-049), finds the header cells from the table frame's top
  edge, and maps each printed label back to its column by the site's own header rule
  (prefix stripped, `PREFIX`→`PFX`, `SUFFIX`→`SFX`, split at the underscore). Only
  the sourced columns are printed, so the unsourced ones come back blank — exactly
  what the Excel edition holds. It REFUSES a print whose header differs between
  pages, a label it does not know, or text outside every column, so a layout change
  fails loudly instead of shifting values.
- **vs TSN** (`compare_clean_road_tsn`) compares each edition against the TSN
  extract of the same name — `CA HIGHWAYS` (09/08/2025), `CA INTERSECTIONS`
  (09/03/2025), `CA RAMPS` (09/08/2025) — which the TSN library normalizes once
  (`tsn_load_clean_road`). Rows pair on the physical location: route + county +
  postmile prefix + begin postmile + roadbed (`R`/`L`/`X`; the site's equation marker
  `E` is not a roadbed). The unsourced columns are context, never counted. The values
  are normalized only where the two systems spell the same fact differently: dates to
  ISO, the TSN `I`/`R` design-code prefix, a trailing period on the county, a blank
  toll/forest flag as `0`, the Intersection control code through the Intersection
  Detail rule, and the Ramp on/off code `Z` as `OTH`.
- **PDF vs Excel** pairs the two editions record for record, and all three match on
  the delivery. The site's Excel file writes 4 Ramp descriptions with a trailing
  `_x000d_` (an escaped carriage return — route 010's Cactus City rest-area ramps,
  the same four Ramp Detail carries); the print cannot carry it, so the self-check
  decodes it away like every PDF-vs-Excel flavor (CMP-AUD-197). The vs-TSN flavors
  read it decoded, the way installed Excel shows the cell, and the carriage return
  still compares.
- **Bound result** (the 2026-10-02 export vs the September 2025 extracts — migration
  drift, D5): Ramp 15,204 rows paired, 10 TSMIS-only, 206 TSN-only, 15,993 differing
  cells (14,954 of them `RAM_BEGIN_DATE`); Intersection 16,201 paired, 260 / 425
  one-sided, 5,599 cells; Highway 47,746 paired, 3,989 / 12,337 one-sided, 141,593
  cells.
- **Cross-environment** keys every row on the file's route token, the identity the
  engine requires, and reads the PDF edition through the same print reader.
- **A row with no postmile** (v0.50.0). The 2026-10-22 dev-site Highway export has 385
  rows on routes 001 and 003 whose begin and end postmiles are blank (the 2026-10-02
  export had none). Every flavor keys such a row on its odometer — `no postmile @
  odometer 7.199` — instead of stopping, so it lists one-sided (or pairs with the same
  row in the other render or day), and the Notes sheet counts them by route. On that
  export: Highway 47,459 paired, 4,176 / 12,624 one-sided,
  140,150 cells; Intersection 16,125 / 260 / 501, 5,587; Ramp 15,204 / 10 / 206,
  15,994.

Evidence images are not wired for these prints.

### Coalescing both editions of a report (v0.19.2)

When the user selects **both editions of one on-site report** — the two formats share a `data_value` (Highway Log, Intersection Detail, Highway Detail; Highway Sequence + Ramp Detail joined in v0.24.0; Ramp Summary + Intersection Summary in v0.25.1) — the standard (sequential) export path generates the report **once per route** and saves both files off that single render, instead of generating it twice. `ExportWorker._run_specs` groups the selected specs by `data_value` (`_coalesce_groups`) and runs a pair through `exporter.run_export_combined`; the **Export-button save runs first** and the **DOM-rebuilding PDF Print save last** (`_PAGE_REBUILDING_SAVES` / `_save_rebuilds_page`), because `hl_printAll`/`intd_printAll`/`hd_printAll` replace `#rampResults` and would remove the Export button. Each edition keeps its own `RunResult`, staging/swap, run report, and auto-consolidation (`_prep_edition` / `_finish_edition`). **Scope:** the single-report `run_export` and the parallel engine are untouched; **fast mode** keeps each edition its own parallel pass (coalescing the parallel engine, and the console `run_cli_multi`, are follow-ups). Locked by `build/check_coalesce_editions.py`.

## `cs-disabled` -- the site can temporarily disable a report (EXPECTED)

TSMIS can temporarily disable individual reports from exporting, **by design (server-side)**. The site greys a disabled report's `<li>` with the `cs-disabled` class. This is NOT a bug -- on the live build the TSAR Ramp Summary + Ramp Detail `<li>` carried `cs-disabled` (observed in the captured live-site source — off-repo, not in this codebase), and the maintainer confirmed this is the intended on-site mechanism. If a report shows up greyed, that's normal, not breakage.

- **`select_report` (`report_nav`, re-exported by `common.py`)** clicks `#customReport`, locates the report's option (by `data-value` first, then exact text / `data-label` — see [Report grouping & site-menu-safe selection](#report-grouping--site-menu-safe-selection-v0181)), reveals the `cs-submenu` fly-out if it's a leaf, reads the option's classes (and its parent fly-out's), and if `cs-disabled` is present **raises `ReportUnavailableError`** (a `PreflightError` subclass) with a specific message: *"<report> is currently unavailable on the TSMIS site (the report is temporarily turned off there). Try another report, or try this one again later."* A disabled `<li>` has no `pointer-events:none`, so a Playwright click would silently no-op and the run would stall ~30 s into a generic preflight error -- `ReportUnavailableError` turns that into one clear "currently unavailable" message, surfaced as-is by `preflight` (it does not re-wrap it as "the page looks different").
- **The env-access scan** (Settings > Check all environments) reads the dropdown's per-report availability for every `EXPORT_REPORTS` row, so any label drift or temporary disable shows up there as "missing"/greyed without running an export. Owned by [it-and-security.md](it-and-security.md); also see the env scan / `EmptyExport` / no-download fast-fail details in [engine-and-reliability.md](engine-and-reliability.md).

## Report-related Common Issues

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Route fails instantly with a "TSMIS site error" | The site can't build that route (`#rampResults` gets an `error` class, detected via `common.ERROR_JS` -> `ReportError`) | Expected -- recorded `failed` (see `FAILURES_DIR`); a TSMIS issue |
| One report's output wrong | That report's selector changed | Edit only its `ReportSpec` |
| "page looks different than expected" | Preflight failed -- the site changed | Check `LOG_DIR`/`FAILURES_DIR`; update selectors |
| A report shows greyed / "currently unavailable" | `cs-disabled` on the live site (temporary server-side disable) | Expected -- try another report or later |

## The integration ladder — every touchpoint when a report levels up

A report climbs four tiers: **export → consolidate → compare (vs TSN / env / self) →
evidence**. Each tier below lists EVERY file/registry a change touches — the recipes
that follow hold the per-file detail; this is the completeness checklist (the v0.17.3
lesson: a missed special-case in one of these shipped a field crash). The proven
sequence for a print edition is Highway Detail (v0.19.2 export → v0.20.0 full) and
Highway Sequence (v0.24.0 export → v0.25.0 full): **ship the export first, then
census real work-PC output before blessing any parser (Lesson 13)** — never integrate
off synthetic renders.

**Tier 0 — Export** ([recipe](#recipe-add-a-new-report-type)):
- [ ] `scripts/export_<name>.py` (`ReportSpec`: `label`, **`data_value`** from the site
      capture, `subdir`, `filename`, `wait_js`, `is_empty`, `save`) + `run_cli`.
- [ ] For a **print edition**: the site's print-function name from the capture
      (`*_printAll` or the shared `printAll()` dispatcher), a `save_*_pdf` in
      `exporter.py` (override `window.print` to raise; fail loudly on missing
      fn/layout), portrait/landscape matched to the TSN print, membership in
      `_PAGE_REBUILDING_SAVES` (coalescing order), an empty-backstop row count.
- [ ] `report_catalog.EXPORT` — **append LAST** (stable ids are append-only;
      `batch_manifest._V017_EXPORT_ORDER == EXPORT_KEYS` must keep holding), plus
      `_PICKER_ORDER` + optional `group`/`short_label`.
- [ ] `3. run export...bat` + `5. fast export...bat` branches; `build/app.spec`
      `APP_MODULES`; `scripts/ui/mock.js` report list; `output/<subdir>/.gitkeep` +
      `.gitignore`; `build/check_report_catalog.py` frozen baseline (+
      `check_stable_ids`).
- [ ] Docs: the catalog table here + project-guide.md's table + CHANGELOG.

**Tier 1 — Consolidate** ([recipe](#recipe-add-a-new-consolidator)):
- [ ] `scripts/consolidate_<name>.py` — console-free, day-aware
      (`consolidate(events, confirm_overwrite, day=None)` + `input_dir_for` /
      `out_path_for`), transactional write (temp + `os.replace`, keep-last-good),
      producer-owned completion (`outcome.py` from structured counts) + the
      `consolidation_meta` sidecar. XLSX report → wrap `consolidate_xlsx`; PDF/print
      → a standalone parser censused on real exports first.
- [ ] `report_catalog.CONSOLIDATE` entry; `_AUTO_CONSOLIDATOR` **only for Excel-input
      families** (PDF-sourced consolidators need a scratch convert dir — the matrix
      runs them via `matrix_build._pdf_store_consolidator` instead).
- [ ] `4. consolidate...bat` menu entry + renumber (registry-parity-checked);
      `APP_MODULES`; mock.js `CONS_REPORTS` + consolidate radios; baselines.

**Tier 2 — Compare** ([recipe](#recipe-add-a-new-comparison-type); comparisons ride
`compare_tsn_common` over the regression-locked `compare_core` — never hand-roll):
- [ ] **Hand-reconcile the two raw files FIRST** and lock the approved counts as
      canaries in [tsn-parsers.md](tsn-parsers.md).
- [ ] `report_catalog.TSN` `TsnEntry` (raw kind + lazy builder +
      `normalization_version` — bump it on EVERY normalizer behavior change, or the
      cached library silently bypasses the change) + the `tsn_load_*`/builder module.
- [ ] `scripts/compare_<name>_tsn.py` (flat / aggregate / composite-key per the
      references) and, for a PDF edition, `compare_<name>_pdf.py` with
      `TSMIS_PDF_VS_TSN` + `TSMIS_PDF_VS_EXCEL` flavors riding the Excel module's
      loaders/schema.
- [ ] `report_catalog.COMPARE` rows (`tsn` + `env`; PDF↔Excel lives under `env`);
      `compare_env.EnvCompare` (+ `flat_pdf_loader` for a PDF edition).
- [ ] **Matrix wiring — mirror EVERY special-case, not just labels:**
      `matrix_state._row_modes` + `tsn_comparator_for` + `_pdf_self_comparator`;
      `matrix_build._pdf_store_consolidator`; `day_matrix`'s pdf-format tuple;
      `gui_worker_maint` delete lists (legacy output dirs + consolidated filenames).
- [ ] Golden check `build/check_compare_<name>_tsn.py` wired into
      `.github/workflows/checks.yml`; row-count pins in `check_matrix` /
      `check_matrix_tsn` / `check_matrix_bridge` / `check_compare_env_*`; mock.js
      matrix rows + `mockMatrixModes` + compare radios (picker-family order).
- [ ] Docs: [comparison-engine.md](comparison-engine.md) §9 tables +
      [tsn-parsers.md](tsn-parsers.md) schema/canaries.

**Tier 3 — Evidence images** (needs a ROW-LEVEL vs-TSN comparison + a TSMIS PDF
edition + TSN prints; → [comparison-engine.md](comparison-engine.md) §13):
- [ ] `scripts/evidence_<name>.py` — the TSMIS locator as the word-object-keeping
      TWIN of the consolidator's classifier (pin them identical in
      `check_visual_evidence`), projections through the comparator's own normalizers,
      diffs judged via `compare_core.compared_cell` (context/ditto cells can never
      enumerate), district routing (sidecar columns, or the HL/HSL per-print SENTINEL
      when the report carries no district).
- [ ] `visual_evidence.py` registration: `_ADAPTER_MODULES` (BOTH rows of the family),
      `TSMIS_PDF_SUBDIR`, `TSN_PDF_REPORT`, `_TSN_PDF_LABELS`, and `_TSN_PDFS_IN_RAW`
      if the TSN prints ARE the library's raw inputs; else set
      `TsnEntry.evidence_pdfs=True` so `ensure_layout` creates + hints the `pdf/`
      drop folder.
- [ ] `self_test._DYNAMIC_REPORT_MODULES` + `APP_MODULES` (the adapter loads
      dynamically); `check_visual_evidence` pins (fields/maps/projection/classifier
      fixtures); mock.js evidence block (rows, reports, `row_reports`, unsupported
      list); e2e on real data before shipping (examples must parse-back-verify).

**Every tier:** run the FULL release gate (`build/run_checks.py -j 4 -k` + byte-compile
+ ruff + `build.ps1 -SelfTest`) — a subset once shipped a field crash — and update the
[capability matrix](#capability-matrix--what-the-app-can-do-with-each-report) above.

## Recipe: add a new report type

1. **`scripts/export_<name>.py`** -- a `ReportSpec` (`label` = the option's text / `data-label`, **`data_value`** = the option's stable `data-value` id, `subdir`, `filename`, `wait_js`, `is_empty`, `save` -- reuse `save_pdf_letter` / `save_via_export_button`) + `run_cli(SPEC, title=...)`.
2. Add a branch to `3. run_export...bat` and `5. fast export...bat`.
3. Add one `ExportEntry` to `report_catalog.py` (the metadata SoT — `reports.py` derives `EXPORT_REPORTS`; feeds GUI + `export_multi`; set an optional **`group` + `short_label`** to place it under a picker family + add it to `_PICKER_ORDER`, else it lists flat). Update the frozen baseline in `build/check_report_catalog.py`.
4. List the new export module **and** any new flat module in `APP_MODULES` in `build/app.spec` (lazy imports need it; `check_app_modules` enforces completeness).
5. Add the report's fixtures to `scripts/ui/mock.js` (the `#mock` GUI preview reads its report lists from there, **not** `app.js`; `check_report_catalog` checks mock parity).
6. Add `output/<name>/.gitkeep`, whitelist in `.gitignore`.
7. Document in the table at the top of this doc (and project-guide.md's Supported Reports table).

For a PDF print-edition of an existing report (like Highway Log (PDF) / Intersection Detail (PDF)), keep the dropdown `label` of the Excel report, give it a distinct `subdir` + menu label, **append it LAST** in the catalog (so existing export-op keys keep their manifest-v1 positions — CR-002-RM4), and mirror every PDF-edition special-case in `matrix.py` / `day_matrix.py` / `gui_worker.py` (not just the labels).

## Recipe: add a new consolidator

Implement `consolidate(events, confirm_overwrite) -> ConsolidateResult` -- **console-free**: log via `events.on_log`, ask before overwrite via the `confirm_overwrite` callback, honor `is_cancelled()`, guard third-party imports with `_DEPS_OK`, build openpyxl styles inside functions. (The registry calls modules with the day-aware signature `consolidate(events, confirm_overwrite, day=None)` plus `input_dir_for(day)` / `out_path_for(day)`.)

- **For an XLSX report**, wrap `consolidate_xlsx_base.consolidate_xlsx` (set `INPUT_DIR`, `OUT_PATH`, `SHEET_NAME`, `REPORT_NAME`) like `consolidate_highway_log.py`.
- **For a different input format** (like PDF Ramp Summary), write standalone.

Then add the `__main__` -> `run_consolidate_cli`, wire `4. consolidate...bat` (the parity check in `build/check_report_catalog.py` enforces the menu covers every registry consolidator), add to `APP_MODULES`, and add a `ConsolidateEntry` to `report_catalog.py` (`reports.py` derives `CONSOLIDATE_REPORTS`; update the frozen baseline). Document here.

`CONSOLIDATE_REPORTS` (`reports.py`) is `(menu label, module)`. The three Highway Log consolidators are grouped with SOURCE-explicit, parallel labels -- `"<system> Highway Log (<format>)"` -- so the bare "Highway Log" can't be mistaken for one of the others:
- `"TSMIS Highway Log (Excel)"` (`consolidate_highway_log`) -- reads the TSMIS "Highway Log" Excel export, day-aware.
- `"TSMIS Highway Log (PDF)"` (`consolidate_tsmis_highway_log_pdf`) -- reads the app's own "Highway Log (PDF)" export, day-aware (NOT a dropped folder); parsed into the SAME 31-column format as the Excel export, the accurate substitute for the buggy vendor Excel.
- `"TSN Highway Log (PDF)"` (`consolidate_tsn_highway_log`) -- TSN district PDFs the user drops into `tsn_library/highway_log/raw/` (from OUTSIDE the app; the library is the one drop location since v0.30.0 retired `input/`, and `day` is ignored).
- `"Intersection Detail"` (`consolidate_intersection_detail`, v0.17.0) -- a thin `consolidate_xlsx` wrapper (sheet "Intersection Detail"; 35 cols since the July-2026 site update — the wrapper passes the files' own header through), day-aware; also in `_CONSOLIDATOR_BY_SUBDIR` so it auto-consolidates on export finish and the matrix can build its vs-TSN cell. (Intersection Summary's consolidator — `consolidate_intersection_summary`, a category-count summer — is registered too.)

See [highway_log/pdf-and-tsn-parsing.md](highway_log/pdf-and-tsn-parsing.md) for the Highway Log consolidator internals.

## Recipe: add a new comparison type

Add one `CompareEntry` to `report_catalog.py` (the metadata SoT, P4 — its stable `cmp:*` key + label + adapter + `kind` + `group`); `reports.py` derives `COMPARE_REPORTS`/`COMPARE_KEYS` from it, an import-time assert enforces 1:1 keys, and you also update the frozen baseline in `build/check_report_catalog.py` and add the module to `APP_MODULES` in `build/app.spec`. The GUI's per-sub-tab type lists are generated from the derived rows `(label, module_or_adapter, kind, group)`; as of P3 (v0.18.0) **selection travels by each row's stable `cmp:*` key**, so the row order is only the UI-radio display order and never mis-resolves a `start_compare*` call.

**`group`** is one of `COMPARE_GROUPS`' ids. The Compare pane renders one **sub-tab per group** (first = default), and a row shows only under its group's sub-tab. The three registry sub-tabs are (the `self` group added by CMP-AUD-014):

```python
COMPARE_GROUPS = [
    ("env", "Cross-environment"),
    ("tsn", "vs TSN"),
    ("self", "Self-consistency"),
]
```
- `group="env"` -- every report's **between-environments** comparison (Ramp Summary/Detail, Highway Sequence, Highway Log, **Intersection Summary/Detail**, **Highway Detail**, **Highway Summary**, the **Clean Road** trio, and the **other editions** — Highway Log (PDF) + Intersection Detail (PDF) + Highway Detail (PDF) + Highway Sequence (PDF) + Ramp Detail (PDF) + Ramp Summary (Excel) + Intersection Summary (PDF) + Highway Summary (PDF) + the three Clean Road (PDF) editions). Folder-to-folder only.
- `group="tsn"` -- the file-based **TSMIS-vs-TSN** comparisons. 22 of them, one for EVERY comparison-integrated edition (Highway Log Excel/PDF, Ramp Detail Excel/PDF, Ramp Summary PDF/Excel, Intersection Summary Excel/PDF, Intersection Detail Excel/PDF, Highway Sequence Excel/PDF, Highway Detail Excel/PDF, Highway Summary Excel/PDF, Clean Road Highway/Intersection/Ramp Excel/PDF — the Highway Detail pair v0.20.0, the Highway Sequence (PDF) v0.25.0, the Ramp Detail (PDF) v0.26.0, Highway Summary v0.37.0, and the remaining nine editions v0.48.0). Route History has no export, so it has no comparisons at all.
- `group="self"` -- the eleven **PDF-vs-Excel** consistency self-checks (Highway Log, Intersection Detail, Highway Detail, Highway Sequence, Ramp Detail, and since v0.48.0 Ramp Summary, Intersection Summary, Highway Summary and the three Clean Road reports): a report's PDF render vs its Excel render, one system in one environment — neither cross-environment nor vs-TSN, so its own sub-tab (CMP-AUD-014, formerly mislabeled under `env`).
- The GUI also appends a **third** sub-tab on its own, the day-keyed **"vs TSN Matrix"** (group id `tsn_by_day`) — not a registry comparison type.

A new cross-environment comparison is `group="env"`; a new TSMIS-vs-TSN one is `group="tsn"`; a brand-new family can add its own sub-tab by appending to `COMPARE_GROUPS`. `group` is independent of `kind`, so the files/folders input plumbing is untouched. (v0.16.1 staging moved HL's cross-env row from the old `highway_log` group to `env` and renamed that sub-tab to `tsn`.)

**`kind`** decides which inputs the pane asks for:
- **`"files"`** -- two workbooks; the module exposes `compare(path_a, path_b, out_path, events=None, confirm_overwrite=None, mode="formulas") -> ConsolidateResult` (console-free, same rules as consolidators; the GUI passes `mode` from its values/formulas checkboxes -- accept it even if only one flavor is implemented) plus `REPORT_NAME` and `suggest_name(path_a)`.
- **`"folders"`** -- two export run folders; the adapter exposes `compare_folders(dir_a, dir_b, out_path, events=None, confirm_overwrite=None, mode="formulas") -> ConsolidateResult` plus `REPORT_NAME` and `suggest_name(dir_a, dir_b)` -- usually just another `compare_env.EnvCompare(...)` instance (give it the report's subdir, sheet name, and optionally a pinned header / base `CompareSchema`). The per-route files are read straight from both folders (no consolidation first).

Current `COMPARE_REPORTS` rows:

This table is DERIVED from `report_catalog.COMPARE` (the labels are verbatim);
`build/check_docs_capability.py` fails if it drifts from the catalog — edit the
catalog, then re-run that check to resync. The `env` folder rows drive the
matrices; the `tsn` file rows are the vs-TSN comparators; the `self` file rows
are the PDF-vs-Excel self-checks (CMP-AUD-014, moved out of `env`).

**Don't hand-roll workbook output**: build a `CompareSchema` and call `compare_core.run_compare` -- that's the approved workbook style for free, and the core's text/formulas are regression-locked. See [comparison-engine.md](comparison-engine.md) (engine + regression-lock harness) and [highway_log/comparison-study.md](highway_log/comparison-study.md) (the PDF-vs-Excel/TSN findings).

**Extra steps for a `group="tsn"` (vs-TSN) report (v0.17.0):** beyond the `COMPARE_REPORTS` row + `APP_MODULES`, (1) register the report's TSN source by adding a `TsnEntry` to `report_catalog.py` (its raw format + a `build_into` builder; `tsn_library._REPORTS` derives from it) so the matrices resolve it from the canonical library; (2) add the golden check (`build/check_compare_<report>_tsn.py`; `build/run_checks.py` picks up every `check_*.py`, CI included); (3) reconcile both raw files by hand FIRST and lock the approved counts in [tsn-parsers.md](tsn-parsers.md). `compare_ramp_detail_tsn` is the **FLAT** reference: a `"files"` adapter whose two loaders project each side's own shape onto one shared, PM-keyed header, with the TSN-only columns marked `context_fields` (shown, never counted). `compare_ramp_summary_tsn` is the **AGGREGATE** reference: each side reduces to one statewide `{category: count}` table compared with `has_route=False` (key = category, field = count), and a familiar "Summary by Category" sheet is appended via `extra_sheet_writer=summary_layout.make_extra_sheet_writer(SPEC)` — the pattern the Intersection Summary will reuse. `compare_highway_sequence_tsn` shows the **composite-key** variant: when the natural key isn't unique (CA postmiles are county-relative), a `key_normalizer` returns a `"COUNTY POSTMILE"` token while County stays its own visible column — the same mechanism Highway Log uses for roadbed-canonical locations. To light a vs-TSN report up in BOTH matrices, the only required code step is adding it to `matrix.tsn_comparator_for(row_key)`.

## Verification

The golden checks for these reports -- `build/check_export_engine.py`, `build/check_fake_site.py` (drives a real headless Chromium over DOM fixtures, covers the Highway Log PDF `page.pdf()` path), `build/check_gui_bridge.py`, and the comparison/parse checks -- are owned by [verification-and-testing.md](verification-and-testing.md). True verification still means a live export against TSMIS (needs login).
