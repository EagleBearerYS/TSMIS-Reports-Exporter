"""ArcGIS-tab "Reports vs ArcGIS" matrix engine (the by-day matrix against the
ArcGIS report builds), plus the ArcGIS reports library it reads.

The fifth matrix (2026-09-02; renamed from "Reports vs layers" in v0.47.0):
rows = every EXPORT EDITION of every TSMIS report in the `arcgis_reports`
registry — the Excel export and the print (PDF) edition are separate rows, and
the reports still waiting on a build are listed too, so the whole report set is
visible and says what is missing — columns = exported DAYS the user adds, each
cell = that day's consolidated export vs the report's ArcGIS build. Both sides
are TSMIS, so they should agree.

ONE ArcGIS build per report (owner decisions 2026-09-02 / 2026-10-05): the
build lives on the ArcGIS ▸ ArcGIS reports tab and is refreshed there in place,
and every row of the report — both editions, every day — compares against it
automatically: `arcgis_side(report)` is the newest ArcGIS build of that report,
so nothing on the matrix picks or builds it. Each build records the layer DROP
it came from (its export date + content fingerprint), so the library reads a
build out of date the moment the layers are refreshed. A build is a
reconstruction as of a date — the layers' own export date unless the owner sets
one — and the comparison's Notes state that date beside the export day, because
across a gap the comparison measures network change on top of any real
difference.

Own store root output/comparisons/arcgis-by-day/, own results cache + attempts
overlay, the M1-C self-identifying names, the shared job queue. The per-cell
build rides the SAME shared primitives the other matrices use
(`matrix._ensure_consolidated` for the export side, `matrix._settle_formulas_twin`,
`matrix._published_comparison_result`) and the report's own registered
comparator — never a second comparison implementation.

Console-free like the rest of the core: progress via the Events sink, exceptions
raised — never print/input/sys.exit. Only gui_api / gui_worker drive it.
