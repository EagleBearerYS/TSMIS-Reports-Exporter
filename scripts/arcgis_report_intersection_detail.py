"""Build OUR Intersection Detail report from the ArcGIS layer library.

The second report rendered this way (Highway Detail was the first, v0.39.0), and
the recipe held: a mapping table plus its own measured rules, not a second
engine. What changes is the SHAPE of the thing being reproduced.

Highway Detail is a SPAN report — the CA HIGHWAYS table printed — so it needs the
span engine, a segmentation, and a merge rule to decide where one record stops.
Intersection Detail is a POINT report: an intersection is a place, not a stretch,
and `IM Intersection Detail` already holds one row per intersection with the
report's identity on it. So there is no segmentation and no merge pass here, and
the projection is nearly direct. Three passes:

  1. the row universe — the IM rows carrying an inventory block;
  2. the approach join, for the ten ML/CS attribute columns and the two lengths;
  3. the county+PM point overlay, for the three columns the intersection row
     does not carry (H/G, City Code, R/U).

Every rule below was measured against the real 2026-08-28 statewide export on
15,154 one-to-one paired intersections, not fitted on a probe case (lessons.md
#17). Two are worth stating outright because a plausible alternative loses:

  * ROW UNIVERSE. The layer holds 38,914 intersection rows, but 22,697 are
    IM-managed shells with the whole inventory half null — no route, no postmile,
    no attributes. The report's universe is the rows with a Main postmile that
    are current (`LRS_DATE_RETIRE` and `InventoryItemEndDate` both null): 16,147,
    against the export's 16,394.

  * WHICH LEG IS PRINTED. The report prints ONE mainline and ONE cross-street
    value for mast arm, channelization, flow, lanes and length, while the layers
    carry ~4.3 approach legs per intersection. `LEG_TYPE` decides it: Major is
    the mainline, Minor is the cross street. Scored across the population, that
    assignment lands 99.4-100.0% on all twelve columns; the reverse assignment
    lands 61.7-95.9%. A rule, not a fit.

`Int St Eff-Date` is `InventoryItemStartDate` on the intersection row — 100.0%,
exact on every paired row. It was very nearly written off as sourceless, which is
the DA2 mistake exactly (`RU Eff` was declared unsourced for Highway Detail and
was sitting in `SHS Population.InventoryItemStartDate` the whole time). Every
column this report prints has a real source; there are no context columns.

Vintage matters here as much as it does for Highway Detail: the build is a
reconstruction AS OF a chosen date, so the as-of must match the export day being
compared or the comparison measures network change instead of correctness.

# The third element is whether a GAP carries forward. The span layers do not
# tile a route completely, and what the report prints in a gap differs by the
# KIND of attribute — which is a real domain distinction, and measured:
#
#                     strict coverage    carry forward
#     HG                     90.7%           94.5%

#
# Highway Group and Rural/Urban are CONTINUOUS properties of the highway: they
# persist until something changes them, so an uncovered stretch inherits the
# span that ended before it. A city is CONTAINMENT — outside the city limits
# there is no city — so carrying one forward across a gap invents one, which is
