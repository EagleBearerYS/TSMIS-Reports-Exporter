"""The ArcGIS report registry — every TSMIS report the ArcGIS layer library
renders (or will), what each one is wired to, and the export editions that are
compared against it.

One row per report FAMILY, in the site's own report order. The rows are the
whole report set on purpose: the ArcGIS ▸ ArcGIS reports tab lists every
report, and a row whose build has not landed yet still appears (greyed, saying
so) instead of the tab quietly showing only what happens to work. Adding a
report's build is this table plus its build and comparator modules; the two
sub-tabs, the GUI endpoints, the `#mock` preview and `check_arcgis_matrix` all
derive from here, so none of them needs editing to learn about a new one.

Kept out of `gui_arcgis_api` on purpose: the checks import this to derive what
must exist, and they must not have to import GUI code to do it.

`build` renders the report from the layers (None = not rendered yet); `compare`
diffs that build against the app's own consolidated export (None = no
comparison yet). Modules are named rather than imported so this table stays
import-cheap — the layer builds pull openpyxl and the whole clean-road
substrate behind them.

Each report has ONE ArcGIS build (an Excel workbook), refreshed in place on the
ArcGIS reports tab. Its EDITIONS are every export the site offers for that
report — the Excel export and the print (PDF) edition — and each one is its own
row on the Reports vs ArcGIS matrix, compared against that same build. Editions
are DERIVED from `report_catalog.EXPORT` (a print edition's key is its family's
plus `_pdf`; Ramp Summary's Excel sibling is `_excel`), and an edition can be
compared only when the app consolidates it. Both editions consolidate to the
SAME shape — that is what each report's PDF-vs-Excel self-check proves — so one
comparator per report serves both.

The three Clean Road files are rows too (owner decision 2026-09-02): the site
now exports them, so "our layer build vs the site's export" is TSMIS vs TSMIS
exactly like the report rows. Clean Road Highway's build is the CA HIGHWAYS
workbook; Intersection and Ramp are point projections in the site export's own
shape (`arcgis_clean_road_build`); all three compare since v0.50.0.
