"""Transactional artifact lifecycle (P2) — one leaf module for three concerns:

  * **Atomic single-file write** (`atomic_save`, `atomic_save_if`, `commit_workbook`) —
    write to a temp sibling, validate, then ``os.replace`` it onto the final path, so an
    interrupted / failed / locked write NEVER truncates the prior good artifact (F9). The
    wrapper is handed a TEMP path and finalizes it; ``compare_core`` writes to that
    path and now rechecks the same optional ownership guard at its exact save boundary.
    Workbook formulas/layout remain regression-locked. The wrapper rewrites any leaked
    temp name back out of the returned result. `confirm_late_overwrite`
    + `atomic_save_if` add the P12 pre-commit re-check that closes the consolidate
    confirm-then-appears TOCTOU window (the truncation half is already covered by F9).
    Both take an OPT-IN `stable_identity` (`save_stable`, PCOA-FINAL-017) that removes
    the two wall clocks a saved .xlsx carries, so identical content produces identical
    bytes — used only by the TSN library, whose digest is a published identity.

  * **Journaled store promotion + startup recovery** (`promote_store`,
    `recover_promotions`) — the Export-Everything store swap (`live` <- `staging`) is
    journaled so a crash BETWEEN the two renames is repaired on the next launch from the
    retained backup: there is never a window with zero copies (F2). Recovery is
    idempotent and runs from `updater.cleanup_leftovers`.

  * **Input fingerprint** (`fingerprint`, `consolidated_fresh`) — freshness tracks input
    IDENTITY, not newest-mtime: a hash of the store's sorted ``(name, size, mtime_ns)``
    (R1-R03). A DELETED (non-newest) route changes the fingerprint though it leaves the
    newest-mtime untouched, so a stale consolidated no longer reads as fresh (F5).

Console-free (the core contract): reports via ``log`` + return values / raises, never
print/input/exit. Module-level imports are stdlib plus the dependency-light comparison
contracts and ``events`` result shape; ``openpyxl`` is imported LAZILY inside
``_openable_xlsx`` / ``_comparison_counts_openpyxl`` (workbook validation opens the
produced file to reject a malformed/unreadable XLSX before committing it — a typed
comparison reads its own package directly instead, and falls back to those).

    open/parse failure ⇒ invalid.

    This is NOT cheap on a large artifact, whatever ``read_only`` suggests. openpyxl
    sizes every read-only sheet on construction, and our write-only writer emits no
    ``<dimension>``, so sizing parses each worksheet to its END: 10 s on a 30 MB
    comparison, 44 s on a statewide 120 MB one. Typed comparison commits therefore
    take `_comparison_counts_streamed`'s single package pass instead and only fall
    back here — which is where the refusal authority still lives.

    The workbook is opened on a caller-owned file object closed by ``with`` (P2-R04): if
    ``load_workbook`` raises on a malformed part it would otherwise leave openpyxl's ZIP
    handle open, locking the temp on Windows so cleanup could not remove it. Closing OUR

# it converts a silently unreadable artifact into a loud, kept-last-good commit

    pointed at a temp sibling of `final` — then validate and atomically commit it onto
    `final`. The producer writes only to the temp path it is handed; this wrapper
    finalizes and rewrites the temp name out of the result (F9).
    Every returned result (ok / error / cancelled) is path-sanitized, so a ``.tmp-<token>``
    name never reaches the user (P2-R02).

    Validation OPENS the produced workbook (not a name check) and, with `expect_sheet`,
    requires that sheet — a malformed/corrupt output is rejected and the prior `final` is
    kept (P2-B05). `confirm_overwrite(path)->bool` is checked against the FINAL
    destination(s) BEFORE producing; a decline returns a ``cancelled`` result.
    Every final destination is also checked against ``source_paths`` before
    production and again before commit; canonical-path and same-file identity
    reject direct, symlink/junction, case-only, and existing hardlink aliases.

    `twin=True` (a ``mode="both"`` comparator): the producer writes BOTH the formulas
    workbook (the temp primary) and its ``(values)`` sibling. Per the multi-file policy
    (Q5) the **values** workbook is the single transactional artifact — committed FIRST;
    the **formulas** sibling is best-effort, committed second. If the formulas commit
    fails the result is rewritten to be TRUTHFUL: ``output_path`` points at the committed
    values workbook and the formulas line becomes a not-refreshed warning (P2-R03). A
    failure to commit the transactional (values, or the lone file) artifact leaves the
    prior `final` untouched and returns an error result.

    ``commit_guard`` is target-aware when supplied: ``guard(path, **binding)``.
    Every parent/final/temp boundary is checked. Callbacks that accept ``path``
    but not the optional binding keywords remain compatible (the transaction's
    own parent and exclusive regular-file identities provide that binding).
    A zero-argument predicate cannot authorize an unpredictable descendant and
    therefore fails closed. A temp that changes identity is neither validated,
    published, nor unlinked.

    ``requested_mode`` is mandatory only for a typed comparison result: it must be
    ``formulas``/``values`` for a lone commit or ``both`` when ``twin=True``. This
    explicit signal prevents flavor inference from workbook bytes, filenames, or
    display prose. Untyped legacy producers retain their old behavior."""

    read or deleted, then revalidated before each mutation: for each discovered
    ``<store_root>/.promote`` the LOCATION gate `is_owned(store_root, None)` must pass. The
    updater requires a direct known ``<src>-<env>`` child plus a current purpose-bound marker
    under user destinations; its exact app-private OUTPUT_ROOT keeps legacy name compatibility.
    Otherwise the whole ``.promote`` (including any malformed journals in it) is left

    valid-NAME-but-wrong-LOCATION tree (e.g. ``<root>/UnrelatedProject/ssor-prod/.promote``)
    is never acted on. Inside an owned location, each shape-valid journal's TARGET is then
    validated via `is_owned(store_root, target)`.

    interrupted one — the newer generation restores/keeps the true last-good first and the older

    can never roll back over or delete a newer one, regardless of filesystem order OR a wall-clock
