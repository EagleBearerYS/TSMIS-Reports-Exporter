"""Clean Road CA HIGHWAYS — the shared column contract (v0.29.0).

One home for the 74 `THY_*` column names (order = the TSN `CA HIGHWAYS`

record the owner asked for. The consolidator (`consolidate_clean_highway`),
the TSN normalizer (`tsn_load_clean_road`), and the comparator
(`compare_clean_highway_tsn`) all read these; none redefines them.

# Columns OUR build carries that the TSN extract has no counterpart for.
#
# `HEADER` above is the TSN CA HIGHWAYS extract's own 74-column schema and is
# used as an EXACT gate when the library loads the raw extract
# (`tsn_load_clean_road` → `ctc.exact_raw_rows`), so nothing may be added to it.
# Our build's sheet is `HEADER + BUILD_ONLY_COLUMNS`, a strict superset with the
# TSN 74 as its prefix, so every existing index stays put.
#
# THY_POPULATION_EFF_DATE (DA2): the CA HIGHWAYS table gives four attribute
# blocks an effective date — left road, median, right road, access control — but
# gives population only a CODE. Highway Detail nonetheless PRINTS the Rural/Urban
# effective date, on 99.3% of its rows, so a projection of this table could not
# fill a column the report always shows. The date exists in the layer the code
# already comes from: `SHS Population.InventoryItemStartDate`, populated on all
# 12,706 rows, whose value distribution matches the printed column in the same
# rank order (1964-01-01 and 2010-12-31 lead both; 1,237 distinct layer values
# against 1,194 printed). Carried exactly the way THY_ACCESS_EFF_DATE already
# carries SHS Access Control's, and CONTEXT in the vs-TSN comparison because TSN
# has no column to compare it against.
