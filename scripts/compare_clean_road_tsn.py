"""The SITE's Clean Road exports vs the TSN clean-road extracts (v0.48.0).

Nine "files"-kind comparisons over the regression-locked compare_core engine —
three per report (Highway / Intersection / Ramp):

  * <KIND>_VS_TSN        — the consolidated Excel export vs the TSN extract;
  * <KIND>_PDF_VS_TSN    — the consolidated PRINT vs the TSN extract;
  * <KIND>_PDF_VS_EXCEL  — the print vs the Excel export of the same run (the
                           site checked against itself).

Side A is always a workbook from `clean_road_consolidate` (sheet = the export's
own sheet, "Route" + the export's exact header). The TSN side is the raw
`CA HIGHWAYS` / `CA INTERSECTIONS` / `CA RAMPS` extract (`Sheet 1`) or the TSN
library's normalized copy (marker-gated). Role gates keep the sides honest: the
print flavors REQUIRE the PDF-conversion marker on side A, the Excel flavors
and the self-check's Excel side REFUSE it, and no side may be the app's own
ArcGIS build (`ArcGIS Build` marker) — that is a different comparison.

Row identity — the physical location both systems carry natively:
    route (name + suffix) · county · PM prefix · postmile (decimal-canonical)
    · roadbed (the R/L/X postmile suffix)
For Highway that is the segment's BEGIN postmile (the END is a compared field,
so a stretch the systems cut differently pairs instead of splitting); for
Intersection the intersection's postmile; for Ramp the ramp's.

Format-only reconciliations, all measured on the 2026-10-02 statewide pull
against the 2025-09 extracts and named on the Notes sheet:
  * dates compare as ISO dates (the site prints MM/DD/YYYY, Intersection dates
    pass the layer's own YY-MM-DD through; TSN stores dates);
  * amounts compare as canonical numbers ('02' = '2', '9.60' = '9.6');
  * county codes drop the TASAS trailing period the site writes for the
    two-letter counties ('SD.' = 'SD');
  * Highway: the site writes the equation marker 'E' into the postmile-suffix
    column on equation rows (THY_EQUATE_CODE = E on every one), so it is not a
    roadbed for the KEY — the column itself is still compared; a blank
    THY_TOLL_FOREST_CODE is TSN's code 0 (neither toll nor forest);
  * Intersection: TSN prefixes its design codes with the domain letter
    ('IT' = the site's 'T'); the control type applies the TSNR/MIRE crosswalk
    the Intersection Detail comparison already uses (TSN's signal sub-types
    J–P fold to the Signalized code S on both sides);
  * Ramp: TSN prefixes its design codes ('RD' = 'D'); the site's On/Off 'Z'
    is TSN's 'OTH'.
Runs of spaces compare as one space in every flavor (the engine's Excel-TRIM
rule) — which is what lets the print, whose HTML collapses them, compare
against the Excel file and the TSN extract, which keep them; the print flavors
also fold tabs and line breaks the same way.

CONTEXT columns (shown with both sides' values, never counted): the columns
the site has no source for (blank in its file by design), TSN's bookkeeping
(ids, lifecycle, create/update), the TASAS change-tracking columns, the
extract date, Highway's two offset columns (each system's own cumulative), the
Intersection connection id (a different id space) and the Ramp design
description (each system's own wording of the compared design code).

TSN is FROZEN at the September-2025 cutover (roadmap D5): every difference is
TSMIS-vs-the-2025-snapshot drift, never by itself a defect. Console-free.
