"""The shared discrepancy-workbook engine behind every comparison type.

Extracted (v0.10.0) from compare_highway_log.py — the approved TSMIS-vs-TSN
Highway Log workbook — and parameterized with a CompareSchema so the SAME
proven engine also builds the cross-environment comparisons (e.g. SSOR-prod
vs ARS-prod) for any report whose rows are "one key column + N data fields".
compare_highway_log delegates here with its original schema; its output is
regression-verified cell-for-cell identical to the pre-extraction engine, so
DO NOT change formula or label text here without re-running that check
(see CLAUDE.md — the per-route format is locked to the approved sample).

What the engine builds (sheet for sheet, same as the approved design):
  Summary       row counts, match status, per-field diff counts, live
                SELF-CHECK rows, notes
  Spot Check    one row audited field-by-field with an independent verdict
  Comparison    one row per (Route,) key + occurrence, document order;
                matched values shown, differences as "a ≠ b" in red
  Only in <A> / Only in <B>   every one-sided row, pulled onto its own tab
  Routes        (consolidated shape only) per-route coverage stats
  <A> / <B>     the two inputs + live "Key (helper)" lookup columns

Two flavors via mode= ("formulas" | "values" | "both"): formulas = every
cell a live Excel formula (consolidated ships calcMode=manual — ~2M formulas);
values = the same sheets/links/colors with the bulk precomputed by the same
Python mirror that powers the run summary, so the flavors can never disagree.

Inputs arrive as ROWS (the callers own file loading/validation): per-route
shape = [key, f1..fn]; consolidated shape = [route, key, f1..fn].

Streaming (write_only) workbook rules apply throughout: sheets created in
display order, freeze/widths/filter/CF set before rows, styled cells are
WriteOnlyCells. Console-free; progress via events.on_log, cancel honored at
the usual cadence, ConsolidateResult returned.
