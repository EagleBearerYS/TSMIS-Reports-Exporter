"""Shared substrate for the five TSMIS-vs-TSN FILE comparators (P5b / S04).

`compare_ramp_detail_tsn`, `compare_ramp_summary_tsn`, `compare_highway_sequence_tsn`,
`compare_intersection_detail_tsn`, and `compare_intersection_summary_tsn` each wrote
the SAME `compare()` skeleton — deps gate, path/existence checks, the log banner, the
load try/except, then a `compare_core.run_compare` call — differing only in the schema,
the per-report loaders, the banner text, and (for the two FLAT detail reports) a couple
of normalizers + a Notes legend sheet. This module is that shared skeleton, so each
comparator is reduced to its **schema + projector**:

  * `run_files_compare` — the registry "files"-kind `compare()` driver. The report
    supplies a `loader(tsmis_path, tsn_path) -> (rows_t, rows_n, warnings)` (it may raise
    ValueError for a bad input shape) and the static facts (schema, banner, has_route,
    deps gate); the driver owns the boilerplate and the `run_compare` hand-off.
  * `make_notes_writer` — the identical "Notes" legend sheet builder the two FLAT detail
    comparators share (title + body lines differ; styling is fixed).
  * `norm_pm` / `iso_date` — the postmile + date normalizers Ramp Detail and Intersection
    Detail share verbatim (`iso_date` also handles Intersection Detail's 2-digit TSN year).

Behavior-neutral: the strings, branch order, and `run_compare` arguments match the
per-module bodies this replaced (the five golden `check_compare_*_tsn.py` canaries are
the semantic-identity proof). The comparison engine stays in `compare_core` — this
module never touches it. Console-free; openpyxl is imported lazily (only inside the
Notes writer, which runs solely when a workbook is actually being built).
