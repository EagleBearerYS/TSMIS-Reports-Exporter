"""Build OUR "CA HIGHWAYS" clean-road workbook from the ArcGIS layer library.

The TSN `CA HIGHWAYS` extract (60,083 rows x 74 `THY_*` columns) is the vendor's
projection of the TSMIS ArcGIS LRS layers. This consolidator rebuilds the same
table INDEPENDENTLY from the owner's per-layer exports in `arcgis_layers/`, so
the ArcGIS tab can diff the two cell-for-cell. The model is the one value-proven
on route 001 (docs/planning/cleanroad-highways.md): select each layer's slices
as-of a chosen date (`LRSFromDate <= D < LRSToDate`; empty LRSToDate = current),
key everything on county + PM prefix + postmile (NEVER the odometers — three
calibrations exist), union every layer's breakpoints, and emit one row per
stretch with each layer's value painted across it.

Row structure follows the LRS alignments (measured 2026-07-22): as-of spans
always carry an explicit Alignment; LEFT-road attribute layers live wholly on
the L alignment (PM-coincident with R except on independent stretches); the
whole-road layers gain L spans only where alignments split. `SHS Highway Group`
is the structural driver — HG D/U segments are base rows; HG R / L segments are
the PM-suffixed independent-roadbed rows (the opposite side's block is null,
as TSN nulls it). HG coverage GAPS yield NO row: measured on the ORA 001
unconstructed gap (14.057–17.461), TSN skips the PM range too, and its 340
statewide HG=X inventory rows have no layer counterpart — they surface
one-sided in the comparison by design.

The output keeps the FULL 74-column THY header (owner decision 2026-07-22) in
three tiers: sourced (painted from a mapped layer), no-TSMIS-source (present +
empty + noted), and TSN-internal bookkeeping (present + empty + noted;
`THY_EXTRACT_DATE` alone is stamped with the build's as-of date). Every column
is indexed back to its source layer on the workbook's `Provenance` sheet — the
layer name + column plus the FeatureServer `Data Source` recorded by the
library's `00_INDEX.xlsx`.

Console-free; returns a ConsolidateResult. openpyxl loads lazily.

    and kept reachable so the two can still be scored against each other.

    `primary=<tag>` — that layer's own date, falling back to the NEWEST of the
    block's other layers only where the primary has no covering span. Measured
    2026-08-19 against the real 2026-08-17 Highway Detail export over 44–46k
    joined rows, which is the first time this had a ground truth to be measured
