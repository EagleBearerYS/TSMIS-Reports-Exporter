"""Compare-tab "vs TSN Matrix" engine (the day-keyed TSN comparison matrix).

A MANUAL, day-picking comparison matrix (a sibling of the Everything matrix, but
under the Compare tab): rows = report types, columns = exported DAYS the user
adds, each cell = that report's export FOR THAT DAY compared vs TSN. There is ONE
data source for the whole matrix (default ssor-prod); no cross-environment and no
live re-export — it compares specific HISTORICAL exports the user already pulled.

It SHARES the TSN compare path (`matrix.consolidate_and_compare_tsn`) and the TSN
dataset (`matrix.tsn_source`, now backed by the canonical TSN library and resolved
by each row's own `tsn_subdir`, with the user's `matrix_tsn_files` pick as an
override) with the Everything matrix — only the TSMIS source folder (a specific run
folder under output/) and the output store differ.

The matrix lists EVERY report so it's the single place TSN comparisons surface. As
of v0.17.0 ALL reports are wired (Highway Log Excel/PDF, Ramp Summary/Detail,
Highway Sequence, Intersection Summary/Detail) — each row's `supported` flag comes
from `matrix.tsn_supported()`, so adding a report's TSN comparator flips it on here
automatically; nothing is greyed. The store, snapshot, actions, and queue are
report-agnostic; the per-row `tsn_subdir` (from `matrix.tsn_subdir_for`) carries
each report's TSN dataset key — the old Highway-Log-only `TSN_SUBDIR` constant is gone.

Console-free like the rest of the core: progress via the Events sink, exceptions
raised — never print/input/sys.exit. Only gui_api / gui_worker drive it.
