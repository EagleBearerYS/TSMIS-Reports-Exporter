"""GUI entry point for the TSMIS Reports Exporter.

Run in dev:   python scripts\\gui_main.py   (or "run app (GUI preview).bat")
Packaged:     this is the PyInstaller entry (build.ps1 sets TSMIS_ENTRY here

The window is a pywebview (Edge WebView2) shell rendering scripts/ui/; all
GUI logic lives in gui_api.py, and the browser/file work stays on the same
gui_worker threads the engines have always used. The only bootstrap here is
making the dev import paths work when run from source.
