    """B3 "Export Everything": run selected report types across selected

    <report>/) by reusing ExportWorker._run_specs, so resume/idempotency, fast
    mode, pause (B1) and auto-consolidate (B2) all come for free.

    Per-env targeting uses the PROCESS-GLOBAL common.set_site (NOT
    set_thread_site): the batch is a single sequential orchestrator and the
    single-task gate guarantees no other export runs, so mutating the global is
    safe — and the user's original selection is restored when the batch ends.
    (set_thread_site is only for the parallel env-scanner, where several browsers
    target different environments at once.) Progress is persisted after every
    environment, so a batch survives an app restart and resumes at the next
    pending environment.

    Posts ("batch_progress", dict) before each environment and ("batch_done",
    dict) at the end; the per-report log/progress/worker_status come from the
    reused ExportWorker. A fatal sign-in/browser problem ends the batch with an
