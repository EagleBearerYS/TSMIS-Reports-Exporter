"""Cross-environment comparison MATRIX engine (Everything tab).

A thin ORCHESTRATION layer over the already-audited cross-environment comparison
(`compare_env`) and the always-current Export-Everything store. It NEVER
recomputes report contents and NEVER touches `compare_core` — it only:

  * enumerates the report x environment cells from the store,
  * computes per-cell EXPORT freshness (newest file mtime) via report_library,
  * computes per-cell COMPARISON freshness (the comparison workbook's mtime vs
    the two source folders' newest export mtime),
  * orchestrates `compare_env.<adapter>.compare_folders(...)` to (re)build a
    cell's comparison of (report, env) against the BASELINE env, writing into
    <dest>/comparisons/<baseline>/, and
  * caches each comparison's verdict + discrepancy counts in a sidecar so the
    snapshot (which the GUI renders) stays a pure, offline filesystem read.

Console-free like the rest of the core: progress is reported through the Events
sink and exceptions are raised — never print/input/sys.exit. Only gui_api /
gui_worker drive it.

# S4 (v0.19.0): matrix.py is now the FACADE over the state/build split. Every
# public (and check-visible private) name re-exports here, and the build side
# resolves its patchable collaborators through THIS module at call time — so
# `matrix.<name>` stays the one true patch/monkeypatch point.
