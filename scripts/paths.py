"""Frozen-aware filesystem paths for TSMIS Reports Exporter.

One place that decides WHERE the app reads and writes, so the rest of the
code never has to care whether it is running as a dev script or as the
packaged portable .exe.

Policy ("portable by default, never break"):
  * Packaged build (sys.frozen): write next to the .exe -- the intuitive
    "my reports are right here in the folder" model. If that folder is not
    writable (e.g. unzipped into Program Files or a read-only network share),
    fall back automatically to %LOCALAPPDATA%\\TSMIS Exporter so the app
    still runs. Callers should surface DATA_ROOT in the UI so the rare
    fallback is never a mystery.
  * Dev / .bat workflow (not frozen): keep the original locations
    (./output and scripts/tsmis_auth.json) so the existing scripts and
    batch files behave exactly as before.
