"""Shared machinery for the table-PDF parsers/consolidators (v0.19.0 R2).

Before this module, the three PDF consolidators (TSMIS Highway Log, TSMIS
Intersection Detail, TSN Highway Log) + the TSN Highway Sequence loader each
carried verbatim copies of the same building blocks: the y-cluster line builder
(x4), the char->column assigner (x2), the median/contiguous column-window math
(x2), the route-token normalizer (x4, one divergent), the TSMIS-format
route-workbook writer (x3), and the ~110-line per-PDF convert loop (x2). This
module is those blocks, parameterized; each consolidator keeps ONLY its layout
knowledge (band collection, row classification/assembly) — which is what makes
a NEW PDF-sourced report (Highway Detail/Summary) a recipe instead of a port.

`norm_route` is THE canonical route-token normalizer, reconciling the four
copies deliberately:

  * the two TSMIS-PDF copies and the TSN Highway Sequence copy were already
    semantically identical (regex: int-collapse the digits, zero-pad to 3,
    upper-case the suffix) — adopting this changes nothing for them;
  * the TSN Highway Log copy used `zfill(3)`, which (a) never padded a SHORT
    SUFFIXED token ('5S' stayed '5S' while TSMIS prints '005S' — a latent
    row-misalignment) and (b) kept over-padded digits ('0001' stayed '0001').
    The reconciled form fixes both. Real district PDFs print 1-3 digit tokens
    (suffix included in the 'nnnX' form), where the two agree — but because the
    normalized route KEYS the stored TSN library, the highway_log TSN entry's
    `normalization_version` is bumped with this change (D2 auto-rebuild).

Console-free; pdfplumber/openpyxl objects come from the callers (which gate on
their own _DEPS_OK), so this module keeps the same lazy posture and never
imports pdfplumber itself.
