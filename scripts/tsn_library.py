"""Canonical TSN library — the ONE fixed home the whole app references for each
report's TSN source data.

The six TSN reports essentially never change, so rather than scatter them across
per-run drop folders (the legacy ``input/tsn_highway_log/`` and the matrix's
``<dest>/_tsn_input/<subdir>/``), each report's TSN data lives under
``<DATA_ROOT>/tsn_library/<report>/``:

    raw/           the RAW TSN file(s) exactly as exported — district PDFs, a
                   statewide PDF, or a statewide XLSX (the format is the report's
                   own, see tsn-parsers.md).
    consolidated/  the GENERATED consolidated / normalized Excel, built once from
                   the raw and reused for every comparison. A couple of TSN
                   reports are PDFs, so this Excel is what the comparison engine
                   actually reads.

Every consolidator / comparator / matrix DEFAULTS to this library — the per-row
``tsn_subdir`` IS the report key here. An explicit user file-pick stays an
override (``resolve(report, selected_file=...)``). The legacy Highway Log
locations are honored as read-only fallbacks so existing installs keep working
until imported.

Console-free (no print / input / sys.exit): functions return dicts /
ConsolidateResult or raise. The report's own builder/consolidator imports are LAZY
(resolved inside build_consolidated). As of P4 this module imports `report_catalog`
to derive its descriptors, which (like the registry) transitively pulls openpyxl /
pdfplumber — so importing tsn_library is console-free but not dependency-light.
