"""Self-update from GitHub releases (the GUI's one-click update).

Console-free core: raises UpdateError with UI-neutral messages, reports
progress through callbacks, and logs every decision to `tsmis.update`.
gui_worker.UpdateWorker drives it from a worker thread; the Update pill in
the title bar is the only UI.

How an update happens (and why each step):

  1. check_for_update() asks the GitHub Releases API for the latest tag and
     compares it to version.__version__. The repo is public, so no token is
     involved. TLS uses ssl.create_default_context(), which trusts the
     WINDOWS certificate store -- corporate TLS inspection keeps working
     where a bundled CA list (certifi) would reject the connection; urllib
     also picks up the system proxy from the registry.
  2. download_and_stage() picks the release asset matching this install's
     variant (with-browser when _internal\\ms-playwright ships in the bundle
     -- the same probe paths.py uses), streams it into data\\update\\, and
     extracts a verified bundle tree to data\\update\\staged. Writing the
     bytes ourselves means NO Mark-of-the-Web is ever applied (browsers add
     it; zipfile does not), so the CLR-blocking field failure that motivated
     gui_main._unblock_dotnet_assemblies() cannot happen on this path.
  3. apply_update_and_restart() launches the STAGED NEW EXE in a tiny
     "apply" mode (--apply-update) and the caller exits the app: Windows
     locks a running exe's loaded DLLs, so the swap must happen from outside
     the process -- and the staged tree IS a complete copy of the app, so
     the new app applies itself. It waits for the old PID to exit, renames
     the old bundle pieces to *.old, COPIES itself into place (it is running
     from the staged tree, so it cannot move itself), relaunches the app,
     and rolls everything back if any step fails. Only bundle items are
     touched: the user's output/, input/ and data/ sit next to them and are
     never in the staged tree.
     WHY an exe and not a script (v0.10.1, field failure): v0.9.0 used a
     PowerShell helper in %TEMP% -- on locked-down PCs (no PowerShell at
     all for standard users) it was blocked silently, the app closed, and
     nothing was swapped. The one capability this design needs is "exes run
     from user-writable folders", which is already proven anywhere the app
     itself runs.
  4. cleanup_leftovers() (GUI startup) removes *.old trees and any stale
     data\\update from a previous or abandoned update.

Updates are only offered for packaged builds (sys.frozen) whose app folder
is writable; a read-only install (paths.py fell back to %LOCALAPPDATA%) gets
a "new version available" link instead -- see update_support().
